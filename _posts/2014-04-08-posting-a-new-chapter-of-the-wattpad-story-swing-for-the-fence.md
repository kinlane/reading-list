<p>Today I am super excited to announce a new round of funding for Wattpad, totalling $46 million. The round was led by OMERS Ventures, and we are excited to welcome new investors August Capital, Raine Ventures, and Northleaf Venture Catalyst Fund. All existing investors also participated in this round in a big way.We’re glad to continue to have the support of Union Square Ventures, Khosla Ventures, Jerry Yang of AME Cloud Ventures, Golden Venture Partners, and Boris Wertz of Version One Ventures.At Wattpad we want to build a billion user community that connects people through reading and writing.</p>
