<p>I’m playing around with different ways of building API collections using APIs.json, and building on a concept I saw introduced by Cyril Gaillard’s story titled I don’t need a business co-founder, I need an API broker, something which was expanded on by Patricio Robles (@probles) on ProgrammableWeb with would your company benefit from having an API broker?The concept of an API broker is interesting.If you had talked to me a year ago, I would have framed my thoughts on API brokering in a more algorithmic way, but after reading these posts, I am looking to merge in my thoughts around API evangelism, taking more of a human approach to API brokering.While I think API brokering in the future might look like more like high speed trading with algorithms doing the heavy lifting, I’m thinking for right now it is something we need humans to bridge, bringing a more personal approach during the wild wild west days of APIs.</p>
