<p>There are some updates to this page that havent been applied yet because youve entered some data into a form.You can refresh this page to receive new updates.Im not sure what notion of best can be applied here - different events serve different audiences, but I can give you a take with the caveat that we co-organize APIStrat with Kin Lane (API Strategy &amp; Practice Conference).The events in the space include smaller meetups - often by geography (like API Meetup in San Francisco) and API Craft meetups.On the conference front there are Business APIs, API Strategy and Practice, APIDays, API World, ILoveAPIs, NordicAPis, APICon, Restfest, API Craft and likely some others.</p>
