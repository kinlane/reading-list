<p>IEEE Spectrum recently came out with a very interesting interactive tool for ranking programming languages.What makes it interesting is that it incorporates 12 different sources including data from code, jobs, conversation, and searches — and you can customize the weights assigned to each source.But the first thing that occurred to me was, this is a fantastic opportunity to look at commonalities and communities across all of these sources.That could tell us about which places could provide unique insight into what technologies developers care about and use, and which provide mainly reinforcement of others.Before I did anything, however, I wanted to test the veracity of the rankings.</p>
