<p>Libraries Hacked is available as a Github, so any librarian, can fork, and launch for their own purposes, with everything licensed CC-BY.I think that librarians hold the key to our future, and ensuring librarians have the latest resources they need when it comes to APIs, open data, and open source software is critical to all of this working.Sites like Libraries Hacked, not only save me a lot of time in researching priority areas like libraries, but also make me hopeful for the future, in a world where Iâ€™m bombarded by warning signs around how technology is used, and knowing that librarians are getting equipped, makes me feel a lot better for all us.</p>
