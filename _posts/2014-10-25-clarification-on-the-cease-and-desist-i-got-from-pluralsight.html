<p>I wanted to clarify a tweet from yesterday, where I said that I just got a cease and desist to take down a showcase I did on @pluralsight API training demos.Wont make that mistake again—if you arent familiar with them, Pluralsight is “the largest online #ITAdmin, #Developer & creative training library on the planet.Tweets are so bad for getting all the details across, and I wanted to add that I actually agree with the request Pluralsight was making, just not their approach.What happened was, a link had come across my monitoring, about a Pluralsight training video on APIs, which I curated, and added the link to my API Design research.The problem was that the link was to a 3rd party site, not actually to Pluralsight.</p>
