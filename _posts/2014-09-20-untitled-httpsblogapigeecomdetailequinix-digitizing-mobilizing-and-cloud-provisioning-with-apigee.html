<p>Equinix chief information officer Brian Lillie sums up the reason he was at Fort Mason in San Francisco last week in three words: I love APIs.Interviewed by   RCR Wireless News at the I ♥ APIs 2014 conference, Lillie explains how Equinix, a San Jose, Calif.-based data center and internet exchange provider, exposes APIs internally and externally and incorporates APIs into its cloud provisioning offerings.He also explains why his company turned to Apigee instead of attempting to build a similar platform itself. </p>
