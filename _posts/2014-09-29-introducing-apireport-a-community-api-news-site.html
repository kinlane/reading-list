<p>I curate a lot of interesting stories across the API space from my RSS feeds, the Twittersphere, and my overactive email inbox each day.Only a small percentage of these stories ever make it to my business of API analysis site apievangelist.com, or my politics of APIs analysis at apivoice.com.Over the summer, this got me thinking, and while wandering around Detroit after API-Craft Detroit this last July, Steve Willmott (@njyx) and I were talking about the rapidly expanding API space, and both felt there was a gap in the news reporting for the API sector.</p>
