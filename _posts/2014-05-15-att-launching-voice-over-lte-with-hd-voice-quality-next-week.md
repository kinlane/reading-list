<p>Summary: Clearer voice calls are coming to AT&amp;T thanks to HD Voice service that runs on the carrier’s LTE network.It’s a limited rollout for now and while the better sounding calls are exciting, future add-on services may appeal even more.AT&amp;T’s plan to move voice calls from traditional cellular infrastructure to data networks begins on May 23: The company will launch a Voice over LTE (VoLTE) service with high-quality HD Voice calling in limited markets.The carrier announced the initiative on Thursday, saying customers would need a specific phone for the early stages of this roll-out.That means unless you have a Samsung Galaxy S4 mini, you won’t get to try the voice over IP service and hear “crystal clear” voice calls.</p>
