<p>18F is exploring a reimagined website for the Federal Election Commission.Were still in the early stages of this project, but would love your ideas about how we can help make the FECs online presence more user-friendly, accessible, and elegant.Our project is focused on technical solutions we can provide to improve the FECs online presence and will not address anything that would initiate or require changes to FEC policies, guidance, or regulations.We encourage use of the issues tracker for specific requests or ideas.We also welcome pull requests if you want to be bold and suggest a specific approach or implementation!</p>
