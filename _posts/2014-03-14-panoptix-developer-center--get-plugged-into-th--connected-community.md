<p>The next installment of the API Strategy &amp; Practice conference is less than two weeks away.Ive been following @apistrat to get a feel for the speakers and sessions as I can not attend this time around.I wish I could as the conference is in Amsterdam, and I have never been there.For those of you just entering the API economy, or for those who are already scaling in the API economy, I would highly recommend this conference.What is this conference about?</p>
