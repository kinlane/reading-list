<p>One of the interoperability, automation, and reciprocity providers I track on itDuzzit has been acquired by the accounting platform Intuit.Usually acquisitions are just news, and not worthy of analysis here on API Evangelist, but I feel the itDuzzit acquisition is a significant sign when it comes to API providers, consumers, and reciprocity providers.Iâ€™ve been seeing more API providers offer IFTTT or Zapier integration as a default option, in their own developer hubs.I think the Intuit acquisition of itDuzzit reflects this evolution in how APIs are deployed, and consumed, something that has been pushed forward by this new generation of API reciprocity providers.The itDuzzit technology allows multiple audiences to create sophisticated integrations with very little coding required.</p>
