<p>Since the birth of the site, Pinboard has always offered a Delicious sync feature.You could enter your Delicious username on the settings page, and the site would periodically poll your public Delicious feed and add any new bookmarks it found.Because Delicious appears to be in a terminal coma, and because working around bugs in their RSS feed has historically consumed a lot of development time, I am going to turn Delicious sync off effective October 1, 2014.If you want to keep hooking the services together, you will still be able to do it through an outside service like IFTTT or Zapier.Of course you will still be able to import all your Delicious bookmarks, as well as export Pinboard bookmarks in a format that Delicious can (sometimes) read.</p>
