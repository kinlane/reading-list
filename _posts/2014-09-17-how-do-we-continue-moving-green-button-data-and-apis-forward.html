<p>Im preparing for a talk at the The Smart Grid Interoperability Panel Second Annual Conference, in Nashville Tennessee, specifically participating on a panel titled Using Power Grid Open Data Initiatives.I accepted the request to go speak as part of my wider work on the Green Button iniative out of The White House, DOE, NIST, and the GSA.I was asked to provide some thoughts on how to help move the Green Button efforts forward earlier this winter, and again in the spring, and just havent had the bandwidth to give any energy, so I saw this as a great opportunity to make some time as part of this panel.In May, The White House, 18F, some Presidential Innovation Fellows, and myself were asked to move the Green Button ball forward, resulting in a new website, and developer area that is all hosted on Github.Im bummed I wasnt able to make time to participate, but now I have been able to go through the new site, and developer area, and gather my thoughts on where we could go next with the effort.</p>
