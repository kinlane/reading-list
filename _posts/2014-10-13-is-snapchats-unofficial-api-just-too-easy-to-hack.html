<p>Last Friday, tens of thousands of pictures pulled off a third-party Snapchat app began circulating on the internet, raising privacy alarms and drawing new criticism of the supposedly ephemeral nature of the popular photo-sharing app.Snpachat quickly declared that the problem was not their own security.We can confirm that Snapchat’s servers were never breached and were not the source of these leaks, a Snapchat representative said in a statement.Snapchatters were victimized by their use of third-party apps to send and receive snaps, a practice that we expressly prohibit in our Terms of Use precisely because they compromise our users’ security.We vigilantly monitor the App Store and Google Play for illegal third-party apps and have succeeded in getting many of these removed.</p>
