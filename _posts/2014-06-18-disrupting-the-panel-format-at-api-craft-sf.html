<p>Last week I particpated in a panel at API Craft San Francisco with Uri Sarid(@usarid), Jakub Nesetril( @jakubnesetril ), Tony Tam( @fehguy ), moderated by Emmanuel Paraskakis(@manp), at the 3Scale office.The panel started, and I was the last person in the row of panelists, and Emmanuel asked his first question, passing the microphone to Uri who was first in line, once Uri was done he handed the mic to Jakub, then to Tony, and lastly to me.As Emmanuel asked his second question I saw the same thing happening.He handed the microphone to Uri, then Jakub, and Tony.Even though the questions were good, the tractor beam of a panel was taking hold, making it more of an assembly line, than a conversation.</p>
