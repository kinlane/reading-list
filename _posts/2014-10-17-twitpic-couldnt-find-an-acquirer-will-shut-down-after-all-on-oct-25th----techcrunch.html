<p>The reports of Twitpic’s survival were greatly exaggerated.Despite claiming it had found an acquirer to save it from death following a trademark complaint from Twitter, the photo sharing service today announced that didn’t happen and it’s game over on October 25th.Users can now export their photos until the 25th, at which point they’ll vanish into the void.Twitpic founder Noah Everett wrote on its blog that:
 “It’s with a heavy heart that I announce again that Twitpic will be shutting down on October 25th.We worked through a handful of potential acquirers and exhausted all potential options.</p>
