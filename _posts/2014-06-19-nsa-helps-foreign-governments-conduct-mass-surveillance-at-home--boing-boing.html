<p>A new release of Snowdens leaked NSA docs detail RAMPART-A, through which the NSA gives foreign governments the ability to conduct mass surveillance against their own populations in exchange for NSA access to their communications.RAMPART-A, is spread across 13 sites, accesses three terabytes/second from 70 cables and networks.It cost US taxpayers $170M between 2011 and 2013, allocated through the NSAs black budget.The NSA makes its foreign partners promise not to spy on the USA using its equipment and in return, agrees not to spy on its partners populations (with exceptions).However, as was documented in Glenn Greenwalds indispensable No Place to Hide, the NSA has a simple trick for circumventing any promises not to spy on its partners populations.</p>
