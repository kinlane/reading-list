<p>I need your help with something.I’m in the business of helping startups, all the way up to our federal government, identify valuable assets and make them more accessible for use in websites and mobile devices.As part of this work I’m always on the look out for valuable public assets across city, state and federal government, and help make sure the conversations around these assets always include application programming interfaces, so that we aren’t just building web and mobile applications in silos, and limiting the potential for public access by individuals and small businesses.Over the last couple years, I have cultivated a small group of API evangelists in various sectors who help keep me informed of important government projects.One of my partners in crime, Alyssa Ravasio (@alyraz), brought a pre solicitation for a request for proposal to my attention from the U.</p>
