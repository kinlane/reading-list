                                              An anonymous reader points out this advancement in 3D printing.This week, at the International Manufacturing Technology Show (IMTS) in Chicago, Arizona-based automobile manufacturer Local Motors stole the show.Over the six day span of the IMTS, the company managed to 3D print, and assemble an entire automobile, called the Strati, live in front of spectators.Although the Strati is not the first ever car to be 3D printed, the advancements made by Local Motor with help from Cincinnati Inc, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, have produced a vehicle in days rather than months.FTA: As you can see by the Vine clips we have posted within this article, it most certainly does!</p>
