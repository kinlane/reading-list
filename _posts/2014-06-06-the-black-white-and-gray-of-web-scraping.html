<p>There are many reasons for wanting to scrape data or content from a public website.I think these reasons can be easily represented as different shades of gray, the darker the grey being considered less legal, and the lighter the grey more legal you could consider it.You with me?An example of darker grey would be scraping classified ad listings from craigslist for use on your own site.Where an example of lighter grey could be pulling a listing of veterans hospitals from the Department of Veterans Affairs website for use in a mobile app that supports veterans.</p>
