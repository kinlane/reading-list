<p>This guest post comes from Peter Gruenbaum, founder of SDK Bridge.He has worked as an API writer to describe APIs for eCommerce, traffic prediction, electric utilities, mobile phones, and tractors, just to name a few.From time to time, people who have a REST API ask me about automated documentation.Theres no one right answer, so Ive been meaning for ages to write an article about what the options are.However, its only been recently that Ive felt that Ive understood the problems and solutions well enough.</p>
