<p>For some years, statistics have suggested that New York City was getting safer, cleaner and more expensive.Now there are numbers that suggest the city may not be home to as many rats as New Yorkers might have thought â€” or liked to boast about to visitors.Jonathan Auerbach, a 26-year-old statistician studying for a doctorate at Columbia University, recently won a competition sponsored by the 180-year-old Royal Statistical Society of London.Mr.Auerbach claimed the prize with a paper in which he made the case that there are far fewer rats in the city than almost anyone had assumed.</p>
