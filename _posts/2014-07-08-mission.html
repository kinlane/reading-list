<p>Mission The mission of API Evangelist is to educate business, nonprofit and government leaders about the value of APIs to their organizations.With API Evangelist I strive to be the independent voice for the industry, providing the public with information about API.The goal is to provide a wealth of resources for those looking to design, develop and deploy APIs without bias towards a specific platform--allowing them to make an educated choice about what path they should take.To stay independent and operate API Evangelist, I need to bring in revenue, and keep things moving forward.I strive to do this in as healthy of a way as possible, without giving away control over my attention and focus, and contribute as much as possible to resources I provide to the public.</p>
