<p>Today MySQL is officially joining the GitHub community, with the launch of a beta GitHub repo for MySQL Server.GitHub has become the place to be for successful open source projects; it has a large and rapidly growing user base, it is robust and fast, and it provides excellent tools for building and supporting vibrant open source communities. All this, plus the fact that lots of projects that are built on top of MySQL source code are on Github, meant that the choice was pretty obvious for us when we started looking for a new code hosting service.This also means that we are switching our day to day development activities to use Git.The MySQL org is highly distributed, with many developers working from home and others working out of Oracle offices in almost every corner of the world, so it was a given that we needed a distributed version control system.</p>
