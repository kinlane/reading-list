<p>Earth as Art I found the Earth as Art page at NASA.At first it didnt grab my attention, until I saw the Flowing Data post.I looked through the Earth as Art PDF, since I dont have an iPad anymore I couldnt use the iPad App.Next, I decided to deploy Earth as Art, as if I was running the project.I deployed ot first as a Github repository, then generated a JSON data store for all images, titles, descriptions and location.</p>
