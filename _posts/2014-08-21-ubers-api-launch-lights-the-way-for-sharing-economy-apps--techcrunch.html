<p>Convincing users to join new collaborative consumption ventures can be a tall order, but Uber’s API launch today gives us a glimpse at how others building businesses along similar lines might be able to juice usage and find a lasting place in the virtual toolboxes of smartphone owners.The fact is that most of the so-called sharing economy apps offer services that complement other apps and services, either in the same vein or in drastically different fields.Uber, for instance, has teamed up with OpenTable, Starbucks and United among its launch partners, as well as Hinge, which marries the hook-up app concept with the means of getting the two parties together.It’s the proverbial match made in heaven, and there’s a lot more matchmaking to be done.Postmates, for instance, would benefit greatly from allowing businesses to build its service directly into their apps, offering delivery options where none existed before.</p>
