<p>Today marks an important milestone on the road to 21st century government: the launch of the first-ever venture capital fund dedicated to government technology startups.Led by the remarkable entrepreneur, investor, and friend to Code for America, Ron Bouganim, the Govtech Fund signals that the next stage in the evolution of government technology is upon us.When Code for America started less than five years ago, the idea of venture capital investing in companies who wanted to work with government was borderline absurd.The slow, entrenched, compliance-driven government market and the lightning-fast, iterative, customer-centered world of consumer internet tech startups (where much venture capital has been focused) seemed two very distant ends of an enormous spectrum.Products and companies in the consumer (and even enterprise) space would rise and fall in the time it would take to execute one government contract.</p>
