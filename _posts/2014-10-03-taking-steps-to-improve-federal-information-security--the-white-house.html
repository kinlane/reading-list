<p>In a rapidly changing technological environment, we must have robust procedures, policies, and systems in place to protect our nation’s most sensitive information.Growing cybersecurity threats make it ever more important for the Federal government to maintain comprehensive information security controls to assess and mitigate emerging risks.That is why today, the Office of Management and Budget, in coordination with our partners at the National Security Council (NSC) staff and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is releasing annual guidance to agencies on improving the security of Federal information and networks, in accordance with the Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002.This year, and for the first time, the annual guidance on Improving Information Security and Privacy Management Practices, establishes a new process for DHS to conduct regular and proactive scans of Federal civilian agency networks to enable faster and more comprehensive responses to major cybersecurity vulnerabilities and incidents.  This new process complements existing agency information security operations, to include network scans, and will provide a consistent scanning methodology that quickly identifies risks and vulnerabilities that may have government-wide implications.</p>
