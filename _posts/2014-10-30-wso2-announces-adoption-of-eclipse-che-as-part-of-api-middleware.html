<p>WSO2 has announced that it will adopt Eclipse Che as the core platform for all WSO2 tooling supporting its middleware, cloud, and mobile platforms.Che, introduced by the Eclipse Foundation, is an open source platform for software-as-a-service (SaaS) integrated developer environments, which uniquely offers the ability for software vendors to create custom cloud developer tools that are fast, secure and extensible.Through Che, WSO2 will add rapid integrated development environment (IDE) creation, developer collaboration, and extensibility to the WSO2 platform.WSO2 Developer Studio is migrating from the Eclipse Rich Client Platform (RCP) to Eclipse Che with version 4.0.</p>
