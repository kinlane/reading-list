<p>I know that some of my readers are URI experts, URL ninjas, and masters of the domain, but most of my readers are not, and I wanted to share some of the 100K view of what I see across the world of domains, in the API space.I’m going through my API Stack over the last couple days (continuing this weekend), looking at 800+ companies who have APIs, and after going through roughly half, I’m seeing some seriously crazy practices for crafting URIs for APIs programs.Let’s start with the general path to your developer program, I highly recommend providing a simple subdomain, providing access to your APIs  in a simple, consistent path like http://developer.example.com--at the very least put it in a consistent folder like http://example.</p>
