<p>When youve been diagnosed with hypertension, its important to keep your doctor in the loop on how youre doing.After all, what might just feel like a bad day could actually be a sign of a serious condition going from bad to worse.Thats why iHealth, the wearable health startup that Apple helped get off the ground three years ago, is partnering with Intel and GE to make it easy for those without any training to send vital data to physicians without dealing with any convoluted forms or having to actually drive to their offices.Today the company announced that it is partnering with Intel-GE Care Innovations — a joint venture between Intel and GE focused on providing smarter ways to administer health care — to tie its blood pressure, glucose, and pulse oximeter sensors to the Care Innovations Connect Remote Care Management, an application designed to let those diagnosed with serious conditions to be monitored by their doctor from the comfort of their home.The Care Innovations Connect cloud-based remote care management platform is a great way to bring value to the data collected by iHealth’s monitoring devices.</p>
