<p>I like to showcase examples of companies who use their API communities as incubators, establishing them as a sort of external R&amp;D lab that invests in 3rd party developers who are building cool stuff on top of their API driven resources.I came across an announcement from product intelligence platform Indix, in my usual monitoring of the API space, and they have a pretty cool program for their developers: Indix KickStart – a program to help startups and small businesses accelerate the development of product-aware applications and deliver rich product-aware experiences.Indix is looking to jumpstart early stage startups use of the Indix product API.Companies that have less than $1 million in funding and $100,000 in revenue are eligible apply, and Indix will evaluate the startups potential for receiving access to the Indix API at a reduced price point.There are numerous ways to incentivize developers usage of an API, and Indix’s approach is one possible way to established a trusted developer access tier, where you can raise access limits, reduce costs, and potentially reducing a new startup’s overhead, and their chances of success.</p>
