<p>In this post, I wanted to give an analogy around how to think about API’s, connectors, and integration applications.This is something that can be confusing when you first start working with or building integrations since the definitions of applications and connectors are relative terms which means that they differ in the application space vs the integration space.Let’s say that you want to connect your laptop to your TV so that you can watch some YouTube videos.What would this look like using the terminology used in the integration space?An API is a way to access information from a system using the exposed system functionality rather than the UI, if you are not satisfied with the out of box solution.</p>
