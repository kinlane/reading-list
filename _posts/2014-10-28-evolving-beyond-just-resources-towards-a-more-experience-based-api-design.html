<p>I really love the thought process around API design, and I am always looking for ways to push forward my craft.Telling stories is one way I do this, forcing me to make what I’m doing understandable to a wider audience, which is also the exact thing I’m trying to do with my API designs—mind blown!An example of this in action is with my link API, which I use in multiple places across my API monitoring system.The Link API has a pretty basic design, that reflect the resource, and its underlying database structure:
I use this API in numerous ways, the original API design is very much based upon the resource that it is, a link.As a developer who understands REST, and very much comes from a world of databases, this works just fine.</p>
