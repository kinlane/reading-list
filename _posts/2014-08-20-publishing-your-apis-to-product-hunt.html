<p>It can be hard to keep up with what the latest geek trends are--where all of the latest digital watering holes are (especially when your old), that allow you to find the latest info, conversations, and links to everything cool and hip.I depend on my network of API peeps for tips, and last week I was introduced to a new place that I wanted to pass on to you, called Product Hunt.Product Hunt surfaces the best new products, every day.Its a place for product-loving enthusiasts to share and geek out about the latest mobile apps, websites, hardware projects, and tech creations.I’ve had the site open for the last five days, scanning for cool tech creations that grab my attention, and when I opened the tab today, I noticed that APIs dominated the top of the list.</p>
