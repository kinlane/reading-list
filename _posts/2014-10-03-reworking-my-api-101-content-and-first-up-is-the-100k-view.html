<p>The home page of API Evangelist has always been my API 101 page, where any new visitor can land, not know a thing about APIs, read the page, and walk away understanding at least what an API is, and hopefully also a greater understanding of how it impacts their world.From the beginning the API Evangelist home page always had a lean toward API providers, and over time Ive added information about consuming APIs, as well as trends in the API space Im seeing.In my opinion my 101 content has become too lengthy, and not properly onboarding people to the multiple areas of APIs like providing APIs vs consuming APIs.I think it is time to overhaul my 101 section, and produce some newer, more relevant API 101 content for 2014.To support this, Im working on a series of 15 API 101 segments, with each one having a story version, as well as a slideshow edition, complete with audio.</p>
