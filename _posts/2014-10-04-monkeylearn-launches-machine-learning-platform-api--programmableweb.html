<p>As one of the newest machine learning technologies, MonkeyLearn is positioning itself as developer-friendly and easy to integrate.It has learned what developers need most from the growth of predictive analytics and APIs released over the past year or so.ProgrammableWeb spoke with co-founder and CEO Martín Alcalá Rubí about how developers can easily get started with using predictive analytics APIs in their apps.Launched earlier this month, MonkeyLearn is a new text-mining machine learning tool focused on helping developers easily integrate predictive analytics into their applications and products.After signing up, developers select an ontology module that has already classified key concepts and technical language into a concept map/knowledge base.</p>
