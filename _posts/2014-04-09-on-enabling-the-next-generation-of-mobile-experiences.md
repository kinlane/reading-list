<p>Here’s something you probably wouldn’t expect to hear from a new Kinvey hire: I find many things mobile to be disappointing.More than five years into the so-called “mobile revolution” sparked by the release of the iPhone and the subsequent first wave of smartphone adoption, the status quo of mobile experiences remains surprisingly stagnant.I’m not saying that mobile devices and applications fail to deliver on their promise; in fact, many of them achieve what they set out to do, in some cases very successfully.But the scope of that promise is often extremely narrow.Mobile connectivity offers a fundamental shift in the way we consume information and how that data can inform, influence, and improve our physical lives.</p>
