<p>The world of APIs starts with an individual, company or organization, with some sort of content, data, or other digital resource, wanting to make it available, on the Internet, in a machine readable way, so that others can build sites, and applications around it.Even though APIs use the Internet for communication, it doesnt mean that they are openly accessible to anyone.Providing APIs, is very similar to providing websites, you can control which users have access to it, where they can go, and what they can do—APIs are just meant for other websites, web applications, and mobile developers. 
Solving a Problem
 APIs are all about providing solutions, to everyday problems in our increasingly digit worlds, from sharing data with partners, developing mobile applications, to disrupting an entire legacy industry who refuses to change and evolve.Access to Resources
 Providing APIs is about open up access to content, data and other complex objects, or systems that exist within a company or organization, in a way that anyone can use the resulting resources in any programming language or external system.</p>
