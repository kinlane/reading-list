<p>This is kind of unprecedented, but Tesla might just open up its electric car patents to other manufacturers.On June 3, at Teslas annual shareholder meeting at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, California, Elon Musk, the companys CEO, said that to drive the adoption of electric cars, Tesla was playing with doing something fairly significant on this front which would be kind of controversial with respect to Teslas patents.Three days later, he told the BBCs Theo Leggett that he was on the right track when asked if he was planning to give technology away.Were trying to figure out how to accelerate the advent of electric cars and to the degree that we create technological barriers for them, its not going to happen, said Musk.We dont want to cut a path through the jungle and then lay a bunch of landmines behind us.</p>
