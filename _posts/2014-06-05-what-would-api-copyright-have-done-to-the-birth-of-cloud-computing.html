<p>As I think about the potential impact of the Oracle v Google case on the future of APIs, I canâ€™t help but think about cloud computing, and how API copyright might have affected the development of this critical layer to the Internet--this topic was one of the areas I focused on when sharing information with EFF for the Oracle v Google amicus brief.Amazon S3 and Amazon EC2 both began as API interfaces, with an accompanying command line interface (CLI).When S3 and EC2 came onto the scene, it forever changed how we thought about not just computing, but how we provided access to resources, that we need to develop the next generation of apps.While Amazon has emerged as leader, there are many other successful companies who deliver cloud services, which either completely mimic Amazons approach, or emulate it in various ways.Companies like Rackspace and their open cloud initiative OpenStack, cloud orchestration provider Eucalyptus, and other providers including Google have all crafted their own approaches by re-using the best API design patterns that Amazon has employed.</p>
