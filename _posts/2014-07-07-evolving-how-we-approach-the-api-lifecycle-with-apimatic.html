<p>I’ve expanded my monitoring on the world of APIs, from just API management, which I’ve been doing for four years, into tracking on APIs across multiple buckets Im calling design, deployment, management, monetization, evangelism, discovery, integration, aggregation, reciprocity, and real-time.I am always working to understand who the key players are across the API space, but also make sure they are categorized into one, or many of these expanding buckets--helping me quantify things.It is always very interesting to see how an API service provider fits into more than one of these buckets, as well as when new players emerge to cater to just one of these buckets, like Apiary did with API design.Playing on this theme, I was introduced to new a new API service provider, called APIMatic the other day, who on the surface seems to cater to API providers with the automatic generation of SDKs, but really is a cross-over into API design, discovery, and integration, bringing a new perspective to the table.Generating SDKs Is The Carrot As soon as you land on the APIMatic home page, they state very clearly what they do Automatic SDK Generation for APIs”.</p>
