<p>This post should tell you about how behind I am in my storytelling—this story is from an event I attended in Arlington TX, on April 30th, and May 1st.While in Arlington, I spoke to a group of professionals who were crafting an online data &amp; analytics course.A couple of the participants were from edX, the online course platform partnership between MIT, Harvard, UC Berkeley and other universities.Over the course of two days, I had a cance ask the question, where was the edX API?Seemed like an obvious question, to which Emily Watson, the program manager at edX, responded, “Its on our roadmap”!</p>
