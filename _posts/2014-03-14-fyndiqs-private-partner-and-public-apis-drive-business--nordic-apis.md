<p>Swedish online retailer Fyndiq excited our Nordic APIs audience in November last year when co-founder and CTO Micael Widell declared one of their biggest business milestones was when they released their API.Now, Micael is working with his team of 11 developers to see how APIs can empower internal structures (via private APIs), support business integration (with partner APIs), and continue to enable an increase in market reach (via public APIs).Private APIs at Fyndiq: Mapping processes and lessons in consistency Starting with a private API will help you establish the right data architecture for scalable growth A private API helps ensure data consistency and naming conventions Using private APIs can quickly become an easy method to explain your business processes to anyone in the organisation Coming from a small startup team that was all development-savvy meant that for Fyndiq (a Swedish online retailer specializing in providing a wide range of products for suburban and rural women), private APIs seemed less of a priority in their business model.As a result, Micael explains, there was not as much forethought into ensuring the right data architecture systems were in place from the start.This sort of design question might be more intuitive for a larger company, but for our November event last year, Micael urged startups and smaller businesses to take the same care with designing private APIs as if they were a large organization, as this will be necessary as your business scales.</p>
