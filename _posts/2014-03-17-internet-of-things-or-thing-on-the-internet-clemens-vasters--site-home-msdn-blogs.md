<p>Terminology that loosely ring-fences a group of related technologies is often very helpful in engineering discussions – until the hype machine gets a hold of them.“Cloud” is a fairly obvious victim of this.Initially conceived to describe large-scale, highly-available, geo-redundant, and professionally-managed Internet-based services that are “up there and far away” without the user knowing of or caring about particular machines or even datacenter locations, it’s now come so far that a hard drive manufacturer sells a network attached drive as a “cloud” that allows storing content “safely at home”.Thank you very much.For “cloud”, the dilution of the usefulness of the term took probably a few years and included milestones like the labeling of datacenter virtualization as “private cloud” and more recently the broad relabeling of practically all managed hosting services or even outsourced data center operations as “cloud”.</p>
