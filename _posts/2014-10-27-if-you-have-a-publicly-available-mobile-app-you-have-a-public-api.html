<p>I’ve had several browser tabs open around the recent Snapchat security breach, hoping to craft an API-centric story around the whole affair.I think SmartBear covers the security lesson around the Snapchat breach well, my motivation in writing a story would be more about incentivizing popular mobile platforms like Snapchat to establish a robust approach to APIs, and provide a platform for everyone discuss the tech, business, and politics of application integration, rather than keeping it all in the dark.Your Application Programming Interface Surface Is Publicly Available
 As I play with tools like Charles, Runscope, API tools, and other proxy and application traffic management tools, I can easily map out the surface area of any iPhone application I have installed—providing me with a blueprint of an API, and potentially its underlying data model.If I can do this for your mobile app, you have a public API, regardless of how you view the world.Bring More Awareness, Control, Security, And Stability To Platform
 The benefits of have a public API approach to delivering a public mobile application gives you a new layer to understand how not just your mobile app is using resources, it gives you a central channel for al mobile, web, and Internet of Things apps to use.</p>
