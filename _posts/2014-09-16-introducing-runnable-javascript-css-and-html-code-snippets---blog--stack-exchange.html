<p>On Stack Overflow and our other code-related sites, creating a minimal, complete, and verifiable example is the best way to get an answer to your question.We’ve always loved JSFiddle and sites like it because they let both askers and answerers reference runnable, working code that demonstrates their problem or solution.Unfortunately, the use of these external sites introduces a few problems:
The community voiced similar concerns around external sites, which eventually led us to block posts that contain links to JSFiddle and similar sites without a corresponding code block.This is an unnecessary burden for both askers and answerers.So we’ve created our own way to embed runnable JavaScript, CSS, and HTML code blocks right in the body of a post.</p>
