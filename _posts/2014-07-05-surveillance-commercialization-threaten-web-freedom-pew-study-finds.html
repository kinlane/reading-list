<p>A Pew Research Center study identified four threats to Internet freedom, including communications surveillance by nation-states and increasing restrictions by commercial interests.Four major trends threaten the future of the Internet and could result in a network restricted by governments, fenced off by corporations and no longer trusted by citizens, according to a study conducted by the Pew Research Center and published on July 3.The study, in which Pew canvassed more than 1,400 Internet experts, identified increasing restrictions to the access of online information by world governments and the productization of various aspects of the Internet as potential threats.In addition, citizens increasing concern with corporate and government surveillance of their online activities, as well as the erosion of their privacy, were highlighted as threats that could further limit the sharing of information and collaborative efforts online.While experts understood the desire by nations to filter out some information and by companies to turn Internet connections and data into products, the loss of online freedom comes with significant costs, Lee Rainie, director of the Internet Project for the Pew Research Center, told eWEEK.</p>
