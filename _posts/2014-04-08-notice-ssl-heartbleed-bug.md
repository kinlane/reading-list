<p>On Monday, April 7th, a serious vulnerability in the OpenSSL cryptographic software library, known as Heartbleed, was publicly disclosed.OpenSSL is a very popular library used for providing secure and private communication for services such as websites, email, virtual private networks and more.This includes most communication with Unfuddle and similar services.The bug essentially allows an attacker the ability to access parts of a vulnerable systems memory compromising the keys used to identify the service providers and encrypt communications.An attacker who obtained the private keys would potentially be able to eavesdrop on these communications and steal data or impersonate other users.</p>
