<p>The federal government is requesting feedback on a draft contract that will define how we access our public lands for the next decade.They are seeking a private contractor to build software that will provide online access to our nationâ€™s parks, forests, monuments, campsites, cabins, and tours.As drafted, this contract places all the control into the hands of one contractor and one website, creating a closed silo and a monopoly.We can create a better world by encouraging the government to require a more open system.Weve already successfully pushed to extend the comment period until November 7th and have the attention of Whitehouse officials and Congress.</p>
