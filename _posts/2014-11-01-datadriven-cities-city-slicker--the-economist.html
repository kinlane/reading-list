<p>WAITING for a bus on a drizzly winter morning is miserable.But for London commuters Citymapper, an app, makes it a little more bearable.Users enter their destination into a search box and a range of different ways to get there pop up, along with real-time information about when a bus will arrive or when the next Tube will depart.The app is an example of how data are changing the way people view and use cities.Local governments are gradually starting to catch up.</p>
