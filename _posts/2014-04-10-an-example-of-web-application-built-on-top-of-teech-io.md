<p>Today we’re releasing our first web app that demonstrates what is possible to build using our platform.I published the code on Github so that you can have a poke around, fork it and get inspiration on how to use Teech.io for your project.This project was pretty fast to build, I used node.js with Jade together with the grunt.</p>
