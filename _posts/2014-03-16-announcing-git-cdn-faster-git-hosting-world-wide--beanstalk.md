<p>Posted on March 13, 2014 by Chris Nagele We are thrilled to announce that our Git CDN is out of beta!No matter where you are in the world, any remote operation against your Git repositories will be automatically routed to the fastest servers, providing low latency and fast performance.We currently have clusters in Chicago, San Jose, Virginia, Amsterdam and Singapore with more on the way.After a long beta period, it’s now ready for anyone to use.When we first came up with the idea for our Git CDN, the goal was simple: reduce latency and issues for customers who are far from our data center.</p>
