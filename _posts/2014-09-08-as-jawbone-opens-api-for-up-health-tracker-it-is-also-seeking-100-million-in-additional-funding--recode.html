<p>San Francisco consumer electronics device maker Jawbone will announce this week that it will be opening up access to its Up app software that will allow it to be used on other smartphones, watches and wearables.That includes the new health-focused wearable that Apple is expected to introduce this week, as well as Google Android Wear devices and Microsoft’s Windows Phone.It also means its software will be able to suck in data garnered from rival devices like Fitbit and render it on Jawbone’s app.The move is obviously aimed at proliferating its software beyond its own Up band, trying to turn it into a platform.In addition, Jawbone will allow device makers to make their own products that communicate directly with the Up system via an open protocol, without being required to make a companion app.</p>
