<p>The APItools Middleware Contest is a distributed programming competition where teams up to 3 people will work to make using APIs easier and, above all, even more awesome.APIs need LOVE to work well, so weâ€™re dispensing some with the competition!Participants can team up or work solo, and they can choose how they want to contribute to the cause of making using APIs su** less, the choices being: solving a specific problem attached to an API (any API), solving a common problem when using APIs (e.g.caching responses to avoid hitting rate limits), or creating a middleware-app which combines multiple APIs to achieve something unique, different, new, fun!</p>
