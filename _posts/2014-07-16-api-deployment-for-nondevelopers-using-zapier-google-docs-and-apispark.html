<p>I’m exploring different ways that APIs can be deployed, with an emphasis on deployment by non-developers.There are numerous cloud services available, that allow non-developers to execute common business tasks like registration forms, surveys, payments, and product sales, and when you combine these business functions with Zapier, Google Docs and APISpark—you can deploy an API, no code skills required.This story begins with the ability to deploy an API from any Google Spreadsheet using APISpark, putting API deployment within the grasp of the average business user.Next, I want the easiest possible way to get data, from multiple sources, into a Google Spreadsheet?Answer: Zapier (or other reciprocity provider, like IFTTT).</p>
