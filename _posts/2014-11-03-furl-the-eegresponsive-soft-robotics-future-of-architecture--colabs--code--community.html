<p>They look like rubber tentacles.They unfurl like tongues.But these organic appendages with air muscles that inflate and bubble might just be the future of your office building.Furl: Soft Pneumatic Pavilion, a graduate project by Bijing Zhang and Francois Mangion at the Interactive Architecture Lab at the Bartlett School of Architecture of University College London, is an exploration of adaptive, soft robotic, breathing buildings.Its part of the responsive architectural trend that includes the use of biometal to regulate building temperatures, digital feathers that filter the air, and silkworms that weave pavilions.</p>
