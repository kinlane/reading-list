Earlier this week, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) announced an initiative to standardize e-commerce payments across the Web.The Web Payments Initiative project will be run by the newly formed Web Payments Interest Group, which will consist of public and private interested parties.W3C is looking to banks, credit card companies, content owners, governments, mobile network operators and others to join the working group.Initial supporting companies include Bloomberg, Gemalto, GRIN Technologies, Rabobank and Yandex.W3C points to the need for a highly secure and user-friendly mobile wallet solution that could be implemented globally across the Web at low cost and on all devices.</p>
