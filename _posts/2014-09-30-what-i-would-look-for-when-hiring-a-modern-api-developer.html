<p>I get asked about hiring developer advocates, and API developers quite often during the week, but this specific question in my inbox from Augmate, I found more interesting.I thought their usage of a “modern API developer” was a little different, which gave me a reason to provide some fresh thought on the subject.After reading the question, my first response was going to be: API developer for consuming APIs or providing API?A thought which I immediately nullified, because any “modern API developer” is both.You should never just consume APIs, or just develop APIs, you should always do both—something that will give you the healthy perspective that I would be looking for when hiring.</p>
