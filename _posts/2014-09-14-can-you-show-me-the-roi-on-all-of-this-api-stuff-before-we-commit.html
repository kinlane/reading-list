<p>I am working on a white paper for a big enterprise provider who is looking to deliver solutions in the API space.At their request I’ve gone through six industries and looked for companies who have over 5k employees and are doing interesting things with APIs--a request that produced some great research for the white paper, as well as for stories here on API Evangelist.It can be hard to find large enterprise organizations who are doing full blown API, because honestly many of them just do not get it yet.Sure I can find many that are doing web services, and dabbling with APIs, but it can be downright difficult to find examples of companies that I would showcase as a healthy API patterns.Doing this research I was looking more for examples of anything “API” happening, any bare-bones, positive signals that could be emulated, and try and demonstrate what huge opportunities there are in these industries, for anyone who could do it right.</p>
