<p>I have a lot of ideas while being the API Evangelist.It just comes with the territory.I have an Evernote folder that I publish these ideas to, and some of them, like my Screen Capture API, I actually make a reality.The other night while writing, Shadow API: Launching An API Before Someone Else Does, I went to add the Nebraska homestead record API idea to my Evernote, and I said, ENOUGH!I need a public place to store these ideas, and while Im at it, Ill enable others to publish ideas there too.</p>
