<p>I’ve been following the work of Terms of Service Didn’t Read for some time now.In my opinion this work is some of the most important legal work out there right now, which is guiding all of our activity not just online, but increasingly in our offline worlds.If you arent familiar with Terms of Service Didn’t Read, I think their slogan sums it up well: “I have read and agree to the Terms” is the biggest lie on the web.We aim to fix that.More clarity and balance in the terms of service that online services employ is critical to the future of society and the web, this single checkbox is deciding our fate, whether you realize it or not.</p>
