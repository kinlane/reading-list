<p>We’ve been busy over the past few months, both with developing our product and hiring new people to help us build awesome products and make your life easier.Today we’d like to introduce our latest team members, and how their work ultimately helps you.Oh, and there are funny stories too.Hamilton Chapman, Growth Engineer “I hope to become a better developer as well as experience what it’s like to be a part of a growing tech company.” Coming from the University of York with First Honours in Mathematics, Hamilton works on the internal projects and realtime tools that make our collective lives easier, but perhaps most importantly shapes the company through R&amp;D, continually finding out ways to improve the way we work.</p>
