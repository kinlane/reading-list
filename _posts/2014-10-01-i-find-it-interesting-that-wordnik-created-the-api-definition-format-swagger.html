<p>Iâ€™m working through my API design stories, and was working through some research on the origins of Swagger, and as Im writing a paragraph on Wordnik, I became distracted around how Swagger was born out of this word startup.You see, Wordnik presents themselves as a new way to discover meaning, and out of this work, Swagger, a new way to discover meaning from APIs was born.Words are an important building block in communication, and I see APIs as a similar, more structured way to approach online communication on the open Internet.Swagger has given us a new vocabulary, providing a new way to describe, and communicate around APIs.You can programmatically pull a a Swagger specification for an API, and within a few seconds you have an idea of what the API resources means, and has to offer.</p>
