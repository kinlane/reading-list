<p>I spend many of my days talking to startups, SMB, SME, larger enterprise, institutions, and federal government folk about APIs—if you haven’t heard, its what I do.I’ve become the sort of counselor for the world of APIs, sometimes just listening, but often times giving advice, and sharing random thoughts with a wide variety of characters, who are looking to understand the world of APIs.One pattern Ive been consistently seeing across many of these API sessions, is that questions around internal API strategy are trumping any external or public API questions.These usually discussions start with questions of API design, deployment and management, but then often times move to strategies around internal evangelism, and incentivizing the usage of APIs in general, not just consuming your own internal APIs.Many are recognizing that the path towards being a healthy API provider, involves also being a healthy API consumer—a sort of yin yang of APIs.</p>
