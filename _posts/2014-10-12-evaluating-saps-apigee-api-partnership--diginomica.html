<p>Beyond the noise festival of SAP’s Concur acquisition, a quieter alliance is afoot.Since SAP first announced its partnership with Apigee, the SAP developers I know have been left pleased, surprised, or scratching their heads – in some cases, all three.Most SAP developers don’t have a clear sense of SAP’s API strategy to begin with.Now an alliance with a leading API platform raises more questions.Does the Apigee partnership mean SAP is upping the ante with exposing its own APIs?</p>
