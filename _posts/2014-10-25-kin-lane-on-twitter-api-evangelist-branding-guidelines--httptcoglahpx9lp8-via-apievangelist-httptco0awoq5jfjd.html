<p>@kinlane What if someone already had the @apievangelist logo tattooed in an inappropriate location?Hypothetically of course.@kinlane @apievangelist funny but it is important that derivative works be squashed; this is what adoption guidelines are for.@CaseySoftware @apievangelist The lawyers say it is grandfathered in.;-)
@kinlane @apievangelist + @mginnard creator of my logo ;)
@jharmn @apievangelist I was trying to make my branding relatable to others.</p>
