<p>Since I’m looking for my next challenge, I’m discussing with many people about possible roles in their company.Most of those jobs are Technical Evangelist one, which make sense from my background, and from what I like to do for a living.I created a list of 50 important questions or information I would like to have when I’m talking with possible employers.The goal is to have answers to all those questions, in no particular order, at the end of the interview process.I wanted to share that list with you as it could be very handy if you are looking for an opportunity in the evangelism world.</p>
