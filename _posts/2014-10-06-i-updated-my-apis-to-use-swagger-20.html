<p>I spent some time this weekend updating a handful of my APIs to the new Swagger 2.0 API definition format.I was already using an older version of Swagger, so the migration wasnâ€™t too difficult.I have about five new APIs I want to roll out over the next couple weeks, and I wanted them to up to date, using the latest version, so moving forward my knowledge using my existing APIs was the best way to prepare.I moved forward the five core APIs, as I call them, analysis, APIs, building blocks, curated, and tools, to all use Swagger 2.</p>
