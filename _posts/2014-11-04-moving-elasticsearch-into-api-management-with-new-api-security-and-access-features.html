<p>Elasticsearch, the open source, distributed, real-time search and analytics engine just announced that it is introducing a security layer on top of their API driven search platform.Historically you have to secure any APIs exposed via Elasticsearch through your own proxy or firewall solution, now with Shield you can natively manage your APIs directly in Elasticsearch.Shield, in the same spirit of Marvel, is built on top of Elasticsearch public extensions points, and is easily installed as a plugin to add security features to any existing Elasticsearch installation.It does not require a different distribution of Elasticsearch, and relies heavily on the open public APIs Elasticsearch already exposes.The security Elasticsearch is bringing to the table reflects the core features you see in the API space from API infrastructure providers like 3Scale--providing the basics of what you need to secure access to API endpoints:
Ive had Elasticsearch in the API deployment research project for some time now, but now I will add it to my API management research as well.</p>
