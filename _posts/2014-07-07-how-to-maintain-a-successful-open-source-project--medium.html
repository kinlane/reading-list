<p>I’ve published dozens of open source projects over the years, mostly in Python and JavaScript.Few are old and stable, others are new and immature, some are wildly popular with a constant stream of contributors, but most linger until one day a trickle of users suddenly discover them.This is a guide on how to traverse these waters and foster your project into something you can be proud of.Every open source project needs three things: A summary of the project’s goal and approach, contribution instructions, and a license.Preferably up-front in a README file.</p>
