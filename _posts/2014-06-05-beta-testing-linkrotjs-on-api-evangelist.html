<p>I started beta testing a new JavaScript library, combined with API, that Iâ€™m calling linkrot.js.My goal is to address link rot across my blogs.There are two main reasons links are bad on my site, either I moved the page or resource, or a website or other resource has gone away.To help address this problem, I wrote a simple JavaScript file that lives in the footer of my blog, and when the page loads, it spiders all the links on the page, combining them into a single list and then makes a call to the linkrot.</p>
