<p>The US Army has developed a pocket-sized aerial surveillance device for combat troops operating in challenging ground environments.While larger systems have been used to provide over-the-hill ISR capabilities on the battlefield for almost a decade, none of those delivers it directly to the squad level, where Soldiers need the ability to see around the corner or into the next room during combat missions.When Soldiers and small units need to assess the threat in a village, or in thick canopy terrain where traditional ISR assets cannot penetrate, the CP-ISR can be deployed to provide that capability.The Cargo Pocket ISR is a true example of an applied systems approach for developing new Soldier capabilities, said Dr.Laurel Allender, acting NSRDEC technical director.</p>
