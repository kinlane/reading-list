<p>National Center for Credibility Assessment is looking to bring the process of doling out national security clearances into the future.As it does more often than not, the future in this case means robots.Alright, well not robots exactly but a virtual avatar powered by a computer program.When you apply for security clearance, you first have to fill out a form that requires you to disclose all past drug use, crimes and mental health issues.Those same subjects are then revisited with an actual human, but the NCCA thinks it might be more effective to jump straight to an interview with a computer.</p>
