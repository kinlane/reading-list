<p>A touchy API topic is data ownership and liability, regardless of whether the APIs are open or protected.Obviously, depending on your business model and needs, you will choose to expose the APIs and the underlying assets to your developers, partners, public developers, your consumers, or others that I am forgetting.While almost everyone talks about the API business relationships, the liability concern brings the legal relationship to the forefront.APIs are considered aÂ contract between the data supplier (or API provider) and the app provider.If you have different API providers that publish APIs from a central place, and multiple third parties use that API catalog to build apps for their consumers (end users), then it becomes complicated.</p>
