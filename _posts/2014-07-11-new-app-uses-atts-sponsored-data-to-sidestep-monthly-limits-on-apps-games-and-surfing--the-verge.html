<p>Back in January, AT&amp;T announced its Sponsored Data program, which lets app developers and brands pick up the tab for data send to your mobile device without it counting towards your monthly data plan.Its a very transparent way for AT&amp;T to make money off companies that can afford to pick up the tab to push products and services to people who might shell out for content on the go.Now AT&amp;T has one of its first examples of how that will be used.A company called Syntonic Wireless plans to use the feature in an app that promises to do many things — from installing apps, to browsing online stores, and eventually streaming video, with none of these things will count towards your data limit, Recode reports. An early version of the software shows access to places like Amazon, Etsy, eBay, and Groupon as well.</p>
