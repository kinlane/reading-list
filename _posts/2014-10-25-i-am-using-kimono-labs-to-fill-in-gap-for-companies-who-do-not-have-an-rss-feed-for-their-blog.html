<p>I am tracking on around 2500 companies who are doing interesting things in the API space.Out of these companies about 1000 of them have blogs, which for me is a pretty important signal.About 1/4 of these companies with blogs, do not have an RSS feed, which in 2014 seems a little odd to me, but maybe Im an old timer.I believe that a blog is one of the most important signals, any API provider come put out, right alongside Twitter and Github.Historically I depend on the Twitter account for these RSS-less blogs, but now Im taking a different path, and using Kimono Labs to fill in the gap.</p>
