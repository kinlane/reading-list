<p>Its always funny to come across the hyperbolic folks that exist in technology, that blindly believe that technology will save us.I seem to get attract a lot of these people with my API Evangelism (its the name), which on the surface I can imagine seems like Im advocating use of APIS BY EVERYONE, in ALL SITUATIONS--when in reality, this is furthest from the case.At API Evangelist, I focus on having conversations about APIs in all situations, but not necessarily the deployment or consumption of APIs.I dont think APIs by themselves are a solution.I think APIs employed by a savvy business and technology team, providing access access to valuable data, content and other resources to consumers, are a good idea.</p>
