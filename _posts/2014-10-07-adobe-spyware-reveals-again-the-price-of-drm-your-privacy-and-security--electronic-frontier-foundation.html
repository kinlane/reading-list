<p>The publishing world may finally be facing its “rootkit scandal.” Two independent reports claim that Adobe’s e-book software, “Digital Editions,” logs every document readers add to their local “library,” tracks what happens with those files, and then sends those logs back to the mother-ship, over the Internet, in the clear.In other words, Adobe is not only tracking your reading habits, it’s making it really, really easy for others to do so as well.And it’s all being done in the name of copyright enforcement.After all, the great “promise” of Digital Editions is that it can help publishers “securely distribute” and manage access to books.</p>
