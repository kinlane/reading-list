<p>There was a very interesting piece from venture capitalist Albert Wenger (@albertwenger) of Union Square Ventures over the labor day weekend, called Labor Day: Right to an API Key (Algorithmic Organizing), that I’ve had open ever since and wanted to take a moment to add my thoughts to.First let me say, I agree 100% with Albert’s post, but I felt that the piece left out some very critical elements, which I think Albert simply left out because he was just trying to get a short thought published over a holiday weekend, but I feel pretty strongly these points are critical to his argument, and should be put out there.You can read the full post over on Alberts blog, but I think this statement sums it up nicely:
There is a simple and universal regulatory change that would dramatically shift the bargaining power: an individual right to an API Key.By this I mean a key that would give an enduser *full* read/write access to the system including every action or screen the enduser can take or see on the web site or application.Alternatively one could think of this as an individual right to be represented by an algorithm.</p>
