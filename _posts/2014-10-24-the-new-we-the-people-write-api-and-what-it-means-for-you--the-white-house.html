<p>The White House petitions platform, We the People, just became more accessible and open than ever before.We are very excited to announce the launch of the write version of the Petitions Application Programming Interface, or API.Starting today, people can sign We the People petitions even when theyâ€™re not on WhiteHouse.gov.Now, users can also use third-party platforms, including other petitions services, or even their own websites or blogs.</p>
