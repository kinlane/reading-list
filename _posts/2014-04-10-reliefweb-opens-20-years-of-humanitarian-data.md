<p>Today, ReliefWeb released a public REST API that provides access to over 545,000 reports, maps, and job listings relating to humanitarian crises and response.This data, previously only available on the ReliefWeb.int website, is now open for easy use in other websites, apps, and research projects.ReliefWeb is the go-to source for humanitarian information within the United Nations.We worked with ReliefWeb and the team at Phase2 on the API that will make decades of humanitarian data open in machine-readable formats.</p>
