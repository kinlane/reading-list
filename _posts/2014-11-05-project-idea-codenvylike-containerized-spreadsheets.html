<p>I wrote a story about a company Iâ€™m advising for last week called Codenvy, who is delivering modular, scalable, cloud development environments using their web IDE and Docker.Im currently working my way through the spreadsheet to API, and API to spreadsheet solutions I track on, and it is making me think that someone should deliver a Codenvy-like containerized spreadsheet environment.With this type of environment you could forever end the emailing of spreadsheets, allowing people to craft spreadsheets, complete with all the data and visualization goodness they desire, and clone, fork, share, and collaborate around these containerized spreadsheets.You could have a library of master planned spreadsheets that your company depends on, and manage user permissions, analytics, and even scalability, performance, and distribution of vital spreadsheets.Using this platform you could easily spawn spreadsheet driven APis using services like API Spark, and you could come full circle and have spreadsheets that obtain their data directly from valuable API driven resources, to really blow your mind.</p>
