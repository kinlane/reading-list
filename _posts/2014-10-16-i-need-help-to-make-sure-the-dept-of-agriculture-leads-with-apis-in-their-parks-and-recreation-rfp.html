<p>I need your help with something.I’m in the business of helping start-ups, all the way up to our federal government identify valuable assets, and make them more accessible for use in websites, and mobile devices.As part of this work I’m always on the look out for valuable public assets across city, state, and the federal government, and help make sure the conversations around these assets always include APIs, so that we aren’t just building websites, mobile applications in silos, and limiting the potential for public access, by individuals, and small businesses. 
Over the last couple years I have cultivated a small group of API evangelists in various sectors, who help keep me informed of important government projects, and one of my partners in crime Alyssa Ravasio (@alyraz) brought a pre solicitation for an RFP to my attention from the Department of Agriculture, for a “Recreation On Stop Support Services” to my attention—a service you can see in action at Recreation.gov.</p>
