<p>I first started Poem of the Times back around 2003, and for about five years I harvested a poem each day, from the top headlines across the  top english speaking newspapers around the world.Sometime in 2008 I stopped generating the poem, but in an effort to showcase the potential of APIs, I thought it would be a good time to revive the project.Version 1.0 of Poem of the Times used RSS to pull its headlines, and for version 2.0 I want to use APIs.</p>
