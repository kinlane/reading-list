<p>Bill Michels, Factual’s SVP, Product Management &amp; Partnerships The pairings of location-based platforms with other parts of the ad tech space are continuing at a furious pace.It’s all being driven by the increasing demands of marketers and agencies to add a solid layer of geo-data to their existing programmatic offerings.In addition to location analytics provider Placed, which announced several key partnerships this past week, geo-specialist Factual has struck a deal with mobile ad targeter Adelphic.The company is integrating Factual’s Geopulse Audience and Geopulse Proximity products into Adelphic’s demand-side platform.That arrangement follows last month’s collaboration between Factual and WPP Group, which is embedding location technology throughout its network of agencies, including the holding company’s Xaxis programmatic platform.</p>
