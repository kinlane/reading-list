<p>Is there potential for a future in which we pay for entertainment based on how much we enjoyed it?A new scheme in Spain suggests so.A comedy theater in Barcelona has started charging audience members by the laugh using facial recognition built into the seating.According to the agency behind the scheme, its resulted in bigger audiences and higher revenues, and its now rolling out to other locations.Asking for your money back at the end of a disappointing stand-up gig could soon be a thing of the past if a scheme piloted by a comedy club in Barcelona takes off.</p>
