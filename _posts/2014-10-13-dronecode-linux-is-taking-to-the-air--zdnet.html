<p>Today, drones tend to run a variety of expensive, home-brew operating systems.Until recently drone ground control systems, such as those of the US Air Force, ran Windows.The first isnt efficient and the second proved prone to malware; so the Air Force switched to Linux.Given all this, it was only a matter of time until Linux would start flying in drones as well.AeroVironments Puma is the first legal, commercial drone, but it may soon be followed by many Linux-powered UAVs.</p>
