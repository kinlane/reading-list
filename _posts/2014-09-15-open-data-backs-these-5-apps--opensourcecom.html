<p>Data.gov has taken open source to heart.Beyond just providing open data and open source code, the entire process involves open civic engagement.All team ideas, public interactions, and new ideas (from any interaction) are cross-posted and entered in Github.These are tracked openly and completed to milestones for full transparency.</p>
