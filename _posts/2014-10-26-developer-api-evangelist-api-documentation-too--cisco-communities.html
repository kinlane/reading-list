<p>Documentation Lifecycle Compatible: It seems like most API Documentation tools expect documentation to be added within your application source code.  I suppose if you use RAML and API Blueprint as design tools, you can externalize the documentation from the code, but I dont know that everyone can actually do that.  For example, this might not be feasible for existing projects.  I want to see a way for documentation content to be compatible with the needs of tech writers.</p>
