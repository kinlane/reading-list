<p>The new Heroku Button gets us one step closer to a new age of API deployment, where anyone can deploy the APIs they need without any developer or IT resources.As I’m working on packaging up API designs for my screen capture API, and image manipulation API, this type of approach is what I’m envisioning for all of my APIs in the future—push button API deployment.You shouldnt have to wait to deploy the API you need.Just as we are beginning to deploy pre-packaged application stacks like Wordpress, and Drupal, we should be able to deploy common API deployments for images, blogs, videos, and much, much more, with a single click of a button.Once any new API is launched it can be configured, and connected to other systems using the API, allowing it to operate as part of larger stack, or stay as completely independent node  that just checks in with the mother ship from time to time.</p>
