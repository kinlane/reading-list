<p>“Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.” 
- Lord Acton, 1887
A mega-trend is brewing that could make bureaucratic hierarchies, middlemen and gatekeepers everywhere obsolete including social networks, banks, stock exchanges, electronic voting systems and even governments.It’s called decentralized computing, and it could fundamentally transform the way we connect to and exchange value on the Internet.Most services today are centralized — sharing photos via social networks, uploading files to the cloud, sending and receiving money.In fact it’s how the world has been organized for hundreds of years.</p>
