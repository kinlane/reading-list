<p>As the popularity of APIs rapidly increases, Iâ€™m seeing spreadsheets play a growing role in both providing APIs, as well as consuming APIs.On the road to #APIStrat Chicago I came across a company who has a pretty dead-simple approach to using spreadsheets to drive data via APIs, called Data Everywhere.Data Everywhere describes their service:
Select the cells in your existing spreadsheet and click publish.Your data will be instantly available in other spreadsheets.Our REST API makes your data available in databases, phones, websites, and other applications.</p>
