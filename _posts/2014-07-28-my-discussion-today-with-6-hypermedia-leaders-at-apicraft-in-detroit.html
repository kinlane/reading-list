<p>Im preparing for my hypermedia panel at API Craft Detroit today.The API Craft organizers have brought together one of the most important line-ups, when it comes to the hypermedia API discussion, that Ive ever seen.To prepare for the discussion,  Ive spent time profiling each of the panelist, to help me, and hopefully you, better understand who they are: These six hypermedia leaders, spend their time discussing hypermeida on the API-Craft forum, but it isnt just talk, each of the panelsts have each also contributed their formats and tooling to the discussion, resulting in 9 separate hypermedia formats to consider: ALPS - http://alps.io/ JSON-LD - http://json-ld.org/ json:api - http://jsonapi.</p>
