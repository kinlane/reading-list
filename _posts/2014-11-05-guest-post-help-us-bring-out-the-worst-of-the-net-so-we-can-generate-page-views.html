<p>This is a guest post from one of our sponsors.We actually cringed, and puked in our mouth a little bit when we saw an email come in from this company, requesting a post, but they paid us well, and we knew the topic would generate an insane amount of page views, so what the hellâ€”we can drink more so we can sleep at night.Our company didnt actually write this post, we just grabbed it from a blog that we regularly read, written by someone who actually understands the topic.This approach is much more beneficial to us, as we dont actually have to have any creativity, or skill, and it doesnt cost us a dime!#winning
When we found this post, it had an informative title, but for the purposes of this guest post we changed the title a little bit, in an effort to make it more desirable, clickable, and shareable by our readers.</p>
