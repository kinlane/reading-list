<p>The Internet of Things is emerging as the third wave in the development of the internet.While the fixed internet that grew up in the 1990s connected 1 billion users via PCs, and the mobile internet of the 2000s connected 2 billion users via smartphones (on its way to 6 billion), the IoT is expected to connect 28 billion “things” to the internet by 2020, ranging from wearable devices such as smartwatches to automobiles, appliances, and industrial equipment.The repercussions span industries and regions.At Goldman Sachs, we see numerous triggers turning the IoT from a futuristic buzzword to a reality.The cost of sensors, processing power, and bandwidth to connect devices has dropped low enough to spur widespread deployment.</p>
