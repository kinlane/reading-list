<p>I’m working with Brian Mulloy (@landlessness) of Apigee, to organize five of the leading hypermedia experts for a 2 hour panel discussion on the state of hypermedia, at API Craft, in Detroit, Michigan this month.I couldnt imagine a more distinguished panel of hypermedia experts, than this lineup: The 2 hour panel is going to be broken into an hour of 10 minute presentations from each of the six panelists, followed by another hour of QA discussion between myself, the panelists, and the API Craft audience.I’ve started a Github repository to gather thoughts for the discussion, from the panelists, and if you have anything youd like me to discuss, feel free to submit an issue, and Ill consider including in the discussion.</p>
