<p>That hack is really valuable, Im glad they plan to make it available.I wish Nest would drop the claim that only a small subset care about data leakage from the devices.Clearly its in the best interest of the consumer to have the ability to disable data collection.This isnt a free product that requires monetization to make it viable.If the consumer pays good money for a product they should not also have to submit to data collection.</p>
