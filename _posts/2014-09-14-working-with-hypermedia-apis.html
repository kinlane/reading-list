<p>You have probably used APIs (application programming interfaces) of all sorts when creating applications.It doesnâ€™t matter what the platform is, developers generally have to work with APIs to get any work done because modern applications rely on code that is written by someone else and uses an API for communication.The ultimate goal is to manipulate data in some way and then do something with the result.A problem with APIs is that they leave too much information out, so the developer spends considerable time thinking about how to work with the API and then making mistakes when the interpretation is wrong.Hypermedia APIs solve this problem in a number of ways, but the two methods that developers need to consider immediately are:
The following sections discuss hypermedia APIs in more detail, but the essential consideration for most developers is that they reduce the time required to learn a new API and to use it productively.</p>
