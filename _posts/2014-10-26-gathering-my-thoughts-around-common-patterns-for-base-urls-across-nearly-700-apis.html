<p>I just finished going through my API Stack, taking a fresh look at each API provider, and looking for one simple thing—the base URL for each of their APIs.Throughout the process I looked at almost 700 API developer areas, trying to find the base URL they are using to serve up some of the most valuable API resources publicly available on the web.Accepting The Madness
 When you look at 700 APIs, you have to wade through a lot of madness.When Im looking at APIs, I’m looking for more than just a perfectly designed API from a technical perspective, I’m interested in value, presentation, and other more meaningful aspects.Often times I will overlook your base URL, but it doesn’t stop me from taking note of some of the crazy domains, and subdomains people are using to provide access to their API resources.</p>
