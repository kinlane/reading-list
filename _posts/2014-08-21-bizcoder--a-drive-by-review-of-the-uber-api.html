<p>Uber recently announced the availability of a public API.  I decided to take it for a spin and provide some commentary.  The quick version is that it is a fairly standard HTTP API and that is both a good thing and a bad thing.You can find the official documentation for the Uber API on their developer site.  In general the documentation is easy to read and it seems fairly comprehensive for what is, at the moment, a pretty simple API.</p>
