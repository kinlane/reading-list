<p>Im liking the new Dwollas new API docs that they just launched.They are using an open source API documentation framework called Slate, developed by Tripit, for their own API documentation. 
I enjoy seeing the different directions that providers take with their API docs.Slates approach is a different path than weve been seeing with interactive docs using frameworks like Swagger, but provides a very intuitive, elegant documentation experience which includes code samples tailored to each API endpoint.Here are the features Slate lists on the Github repository for the project:
Clean, Intuitive Design - The description of your API is on the left side of your documentation, and all the code examples are on the right side.</p>
