<p>Google Geo Developers Blog: Going where you are: Google Maps API Utility Libraries moving to Github
 For years, we’ve hosted the open source utility libraries for the Google Maps JavaScript API on Google Code.These libraries provide additional functionality that developers can add to their maps applications.They also show best practices for techniques like marker clustering:
 Putting labels on a map:
 And much more.Over the last few years the developer community has increasingly used GitHub for hosting code.In order to make these libraries more useful to developers, we will be moving the utility libraries maintained by Google to our Google Maps GitHub repository, where they will join the Android utility library, the iOS utility library, our new Java Client for Google Maps Services and various code samples we’ve published.</p>
