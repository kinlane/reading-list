<p>Keep track of all of your issues and pull requests with the new Issues Dashboard and the new Pull Requests Dashboard.When we rebuilt GitHub Issues earlier this summer, we made it easier to search and filter issues and pull requests in a repository.Now its time to think bigger: these new dashboards let you manage your work across all of your repositories at once.You can find links to them at the top of your News Feed.Use them to quickly find issues youve created.</p>
