<p>A remarkable moment from last nights remarkable Snowden video from the Guardian.In a discussion (around the 7:40 mark) of zero-knowledge systems whose operators cant spy on you even if they want to, Snowden reminds us that Dropbox is an NSA surveillance target cited in the original Prism leaks, and that the company has since added Condoleeza Rice, probably the most anti-privacy official we can imagine, to its Board of Directors.He contrasts Dropbox with its competitor, Spideroak, whose system is structured so that it cant betray you, even if Condi Rice wanted it to.Edward Snowden: If I end up in chains in Guant√°namo I can live with that - video interview [The Guardian]</p>
