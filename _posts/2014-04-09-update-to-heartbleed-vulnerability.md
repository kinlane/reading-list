<p>Apr 9 2014 Posted by Natalie Nagele — Comments We’ve been spending the last two days auditing and responding to the OpenSSL vulnerability that’s known as Heartbleed.This bug is notable because it is widespread (around 70% of the Internet uses Apache and Nginx, and by extension, OpenSSL) and can cause disclosure of sensitive data, including private keys and passwords.The issue has been assigned the following CVE identifier: CVE-2014-0160.On Tuesday, April 8th, our initial action was to promptly begin applying security updates as they became available for the varying types of systems we use.As a precaution, we also cleared all logged in sessions for all accounts and users, this required everyone to login again.</p>
