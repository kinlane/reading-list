<p>Anonabox

 No tool in existence protects your anonymity on the Web better than the software Tor, which encrypts Internet traffic and bounces it through random computers around the world.But for guarding anything other than Web browsing, Tor has required a mixture of finicky technical setup and software tweaks.Now routing all your traffic through Tor may be as simple as putting a portable hardware condom on your ethernet cable.Today a group of privacy-focused developers plans to launch a Kickstarter campaign for Anonabox.The $45 open-source router automatically directs all data that connects to it by ethernet or Wifi through the Tor network, hiding the userâ€™s IP address and skirting censorship.</p>
