<p>Google today announced that it has acquired Firebase, a backend service that helps developers build realtime apps for iOS, Android and the web that can store and sync data instantly.Firebase currently has almost 110,000 registered developers on its platform and the Firebase team says that the service will continue to work as before and remain platform-agnostic.Firebase, which launched about three years ago, says that joining Google will allow it to scale its service dramatically.“With Google’s engineering talent, resources and technical infrastructure, we’ll be able to do much more, much faster,” the team writes.In addition, the Firebase team believes that its mission is complementary to Google’s.</p>
