<p>You can book an airplane ticket using everything from the JetBlue Web site to Travelocity to Hipmunk. So does it make sense that in 2014, booking a camping spot at Yosemite National Park requires waiting in line on a single U.S. government Web site — an awkward, clunky site that groans under the weight of demand from outdoor enthusiasts on the 15th of each month?There is a growing chorus of critics calling for the government to allow the private sector to step in and develop other sites for booking space for your RV at Acadia National Park in Maine, a snowmobiling trip in Yellowstone or just checking on the amenities.</p>
