<p>I’m giving my hypermedia API research a little love today, and as part of this I was reviewing examples of hypermedia in the wild like with the Elastic Path Cortex API.Elastic Path was the first company to introduce me to the possibilities around hypermedia way back in 2011, so I enjoy checking in regularly to see what they are up to with their APIs.As of January 2014 I’ve committed more time to doing research on hypermedia APIs, as well as work to tell stories about how hypermedia is being applied by companies, in a way that anyone can understand.This last summer at API-Craft in Detroit, the hypermedia community acknowledged that they have an image problem, and had some significant work ahead of them when it comes to storytelling, specifically around speaking to the “normals”.Personally, I don’t 100% speak hypermedia-eze, but I know with some practice I can get better at translating.</p>
