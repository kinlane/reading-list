<p>I’m playing around with different ways to compose, and examine collections of APIs.I have a database of over 2500 API that I keep an eye on, and for some of them I’ve been generating Swagger specs, and using APIs.json to compose them into collections.I did this with 10 APIs Im calling my utility stack, because they are some of the fundamental utility style resources I depend on to make the API Evangelist network function.I generated Swagger specs for the 10 following APIs:
Then using these Swagger definitions, I outputted any parameters that are used for endpoints, as well as the fields for all of the APIs underlying data model.</p>
