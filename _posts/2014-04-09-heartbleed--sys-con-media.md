<p>Im happy to say that the Axway support team has reacted extremely fast to Heartbleed, producing support notes for Axways many products which I am equally happy to say are not affected by the vulnerability.This includes the API Gateway, formerly known as the Vordel Gateway.Just take a look at the screenshot of the Axway support portal below, to see all the new Knowledge Base articles about Heartbleed.And if youre a customer, login and check all the Knowledge Base articles at support.axway.</p>
