<p>I recently made the mistake of answering a question on Quora: What is it like to be a member of the 18F team?I have a Quora account, but Ive almost never used it.I noticed this question because the user somehow found me and asked me to answer it, which caused Quora to email me.Its a fine question, the kind of question Quora excels at getting answered, and I think the answers it produced will stand as an accurate snapshot of how the early 18F team feels about their job and their work.Sadly, Quoras policy is to lock that snapshot in their own private store, and out of the historical record.</p>
