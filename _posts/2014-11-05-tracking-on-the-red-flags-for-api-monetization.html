<p>I spend my time gathering what I call building blocks, as I work my way through the API landscape.I’ve been tracking on the building blocks of API management since 2011, and have expanded that to include API design, deployment, evangelism, integration and other areas of the API lifecycle in the last 3 years.Im working my way through the 700 APIs in my API stack, I am looking for industry focused building building blocks, as well as the ones associated with an APIs business model, or monetization strategy.I have almost twenty monetization building blocks Im tracking on ranging from free access to the availability of partner programs.As I work my way through various business sectors being impacted by APIs, Im starting to see interesting patterns, some of which can act as a red flag for me that there are potential problems within an API operations.</p>
