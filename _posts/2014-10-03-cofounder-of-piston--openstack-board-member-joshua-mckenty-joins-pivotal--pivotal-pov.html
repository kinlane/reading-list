<p>I started programming in 1984, at the age of 6.Back in those days, everything you needed to be a “programmer” (the title of Software Engineer or Developer didn’t exist yet) was contained in a single computer—in my case, an Apple II+ with 16 kilobytes of RAM.I was able to learn to write software, primarily because the gap between writing software, and running software, was so small.Often, I didn’t even bother to save my small, Apple BASIC programs to a 5-¼” floppy disk at all—I simply left them in RAM, where they naturally sat when I typed them in.Fast forward 30 years, and I now have two daughters, both of whom are trying to “learn to code”.</p>
