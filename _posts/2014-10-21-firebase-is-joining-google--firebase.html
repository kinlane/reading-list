<p>Over the past three years, we’ve gone from a crazy idea that ‘just might work’ to a proven product used by 110,000 developers.Today, I couldn’t be happier to announce that we’ve joined Google.Two big reasons.First, Google’s backing allows us to dramatically scale Firebase.We’re proud of what we’ve built over the last three years, but we’ve only scratched the surface of the opportunity ahead of us.</p>
