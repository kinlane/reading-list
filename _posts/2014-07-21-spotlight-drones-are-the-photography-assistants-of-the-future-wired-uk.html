<p>To properly light a photo shoot, a photographer needs a lot of equipment: studio strobes, stand alone flash lights, convertible photo umbrellas, reflector discs, and power cables to connect it all.Once you set everything up, its a very fixed location, says MIT graduate Manohar Srikanth.It burdens the creative controls, so its kind of limiting at this point.Srikanth is a semi-professional photographer and has a PhD from MIT in robotics and computational photography, which put him in a unique position to realise a solution: drones as lighting assistants.Last year for his postdoc work at MIT (Srikanth is now a senior researcher at Nokia) he and a team bought an AR Drone quadricopter off Amazon, and rigged it with lights, a motion detecting scanner similar to Kinect, and some newly customised software that would let the drones positioning respond to the photographers needs.</p>
