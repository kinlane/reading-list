<p>(CNN) -- Bothered by gadgets like Google Glass that can, theoretically, be used to snoop on you in public?Then why not get your own gadget that can knock them all offline?Thats what the creators of Cyborg Unplug promise.Billed as a wireless anti-surveillance system, Unplug is, essentially, a portable router that can detect drones, surveillance cameras and mobile tech like Glass trying to access your Wi-Fi signal and boot them off of it.Whether business office, restaurant, school or nightclub: its your territory and your rules, so make it harder for those that seek to abuse it, Cyborgs website reads.</p>
