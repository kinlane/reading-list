<p>Most mobile app developers are failing to clearly explain how they are collecting, using and disclosing personal information, according to a study by the pan-governmental Global Privacy Enforcement Network (GPEN).Of the 1,200 apps surveyed, 85% failed to disclose how they used information, while 59% of the apps “left users struggling to find basic privacy information”, the organisation said.Simon Rice, the group manager for technology at Britain’s Information Commissioner’s Office, which is a member of the GPEN, said: “Today’s results show that many app developers are still failing to provide this information in a way that is clear and understandable to the average consumer.“The ICO and the other GPEN members will be writing to those developers where there is clear room for improvement.We will also be publishing guidance to explain the steps people can take to help protect their information when using mobile apps.</p>
