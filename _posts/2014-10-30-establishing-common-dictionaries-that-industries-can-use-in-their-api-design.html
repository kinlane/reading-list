<p>I’m going through each of the 100+ business sectors I track on as part of my API Stack.As I make my way through each sector, and generate Swagger, and APIs.json files, the language of the resources used across a particular sector starts to come into focus.I’m talking about the words used for crafting URLs, parameters, and the underlying data models for common APIs.In a perfect world everyone would come together and use something like Schema.</p>
