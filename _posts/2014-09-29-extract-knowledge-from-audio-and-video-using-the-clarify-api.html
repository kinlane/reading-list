<p>I’ve been tracking on a growing number of video, and voice enabled APIs lately, and one that is continually popping up to the top of my API monitoring list is Clarify.The description Clarify provides on their docs page is pretty concise:
Why is Clarify popping up on my list lately?There are a number of things that will cause an API related company to show up on my radar, but Clarify has several things going for it lately:
Branding Shift - Recently they migrated from being Op3nVoice, which I didn’t think wasnt that hard to spell, but I know that many people would have trouble with, to being Clarify—which is a cleaner brand.Hypermedia - Clarify is an extremely well designed API which employs HAL, and hypermedia JSON format for al API responses.SDK Writing Guide - They provide an SDK writing guide for anyone looking to develop SDKs for Clarify, making sure they are consistent from language to language.</p>
