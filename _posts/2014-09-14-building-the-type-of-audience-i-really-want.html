<p>I used to work hard to write blog posts on API Evangelist that would have broad appeal with the Hacker News community, and at first I didnt have any luck, after trying to engage with readers on posts, I found myself blacklisted, where nothing I submitted showed up.I lived in some kind parallel universe, all because I argued with a couple influential HN users, who didnt like what I had to offer.I started a new account for API Evangelist, and began playing the game with a little different approach.I didnt engage with users, and wrote posts with titles that would bring in readers, kept things short and superficial, and had some front-page exposure, which would result in thousands of pageviews, and then would dissipate.This type of storytelling ever really turned into meaningful traffic, an engaged audience, conversations, or brought any value to my overall mission.</p>
