<p>The FTC has hired Ashkan Soltani, a highly regarded and respected technologist and privacy researcher, as its chief technologist.The move is the latest in a string of interesting hires by the Federal Trade Commission.In 2009 the agency hired Chris Soghoian, a privacy and security researcher, as its first in-house principal technologist.Soghoian had long been a critic of government security and privacy policies and spent several months at the FTC working on high-profile investigations of companies such as Twitter and Facebook.In 2010 the agency hired Ed Felten, a Princeton professor, as chief technologist in an effort to connect more closely with the industry and academic communities on security and privacy issues.</p>
