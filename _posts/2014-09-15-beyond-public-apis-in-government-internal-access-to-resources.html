<p>The conversation around open data and APIs in government is dominated by talk of making resources available to the public, which is a good thing, but is only 1/3 of the discussion that should be occurring amongst gov-focused techies, as well as the project owners, and data stewards who are managing these vital public resources across federal agencies.APIs are not just deployed to support public access to resources, this has just been the trend that is getting all the headlines, and there is still lot of value to be realized when putting APIs to work within an agency, opening up access to data, content, and other digital resources, increasing efficiency agency-wide using Internet technology.The best example of this in action is out of the private sector from Amazon, and the story of the important role internal APIs have played in the companys success, across internal operations, but also in the public as a commerce, and a cloud computing leader.To help you relate to the idea of an internal API, think of all the times youve had to ask IT for access to something from a database, like a list of facility locations, government programs, or maybe an employee directory.You have to find out where the source of these resources are, track down the right contact information, then put in a request to get a copy of the data or content you are looking for.</p>
