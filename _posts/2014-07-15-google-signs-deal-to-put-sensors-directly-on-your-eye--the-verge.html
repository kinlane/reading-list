<p>Google and Novartis have this morning announced an agreement to collaborate on the development of theÂ smart contact lens that was unveiled by Google X in January.Using non-invasive sensors, the lens promises to analyze tear fluid in the eye to provide constant measurements of a persons blood glucose levels.Those can then be sent wirelessly to a mobile device and help diabetics manage their disease more easily.Novartis has now licensed the technology and, through its eye-care subsidiary Alcon, will look to develop it into a commercial product.Google co-founder Sergey Brin has said that his company is very excited to work with Novartis [on using] the latest technology in the miniaturization of electronics to help improve the quality of life for millions of people.</p>
