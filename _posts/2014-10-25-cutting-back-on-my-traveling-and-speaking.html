<p>I’m going to be cutting back on traveling and speaking in the future, and if you are one of the folks who got an email from me, declining an engagement--I’m sorry.I traveled a crazy amount in September, and put on @APIStrat in Chicago at the end of the month.I got sick during the downtime afterwards, and I just went to Stockholm to speak, where I got sick again—only just fully recovering as of  yesterday.I feel like my most important work, which is my research, and secondarily my story telling suffers greatly when I travel, and takes an even greater hit when I’m sick.When it comes to making an impact, and reaching the widest possible audience, I’d say my writing is the most important.</p>
