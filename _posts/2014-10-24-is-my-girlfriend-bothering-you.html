<p>I’ve gotten a handful of emails, DMS, from folks, and seen an uptick in men complaining, and “worried about my girlfriend @audreywatters behavior lately.First of all this is nothing new, it is something I’ve gotten for the last 4 years, and I’m constantly seeking balance in dealing with it (all y’all freaking out, not her behavior) in a sane way.My public web sites run on Github because of all y’all hacking my shit when I confront you, and looking to strike balance my response responding to you guys from time to time.Here is my advice for you:
If you are bothered and feeling like you should speak up and challenge what she is saying about race and diversity, you are part of the problem—look in the mirror.If, as a white man you feel like you are being compromised, called out, or minimized (unless she referenced your name or @twitterhandle), you are part of the problem—look in the mirror.</p>
