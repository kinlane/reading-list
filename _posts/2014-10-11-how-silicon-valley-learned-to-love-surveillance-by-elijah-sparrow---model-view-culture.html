<p>There must be something in all that free trail mix, the kind that flows like rivers in the cafeterias of Silicon Valley.How else can one explain the ubiquity of what anthropologists call the “Californian Ideology,” a unique mixture of extreme individualism, embrace of counterculture, distrust of government, empowerment through technology, and a belief that all social problems have a technological fix?The odd thing about the Californian Ideology is not its universal presence in the halls of start-ups and tech giants, but how an anti-state ethos rooted in individual freedom has come to so thoroughly embrace surveillance as its primary business model.Photo CC-BY Patrick Nouhailler, filtered.To understand how Silicon Valley came to love surveillance, we must start in the mid-1970’s.</p>
