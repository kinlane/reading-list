<p>While I still worry about the health of RSS, I feel like my overall information consumption has significantly evolved in some very meaningful ways since Google decided to shut down Google Reader.A year before the shutdown of Google Reader, I had developed my own curation and monitoring system, which included the ability to pull RSS feeds, so I was already decommissioning Google Reader before it was officially abandoned.Entities - Business, organizations, government agencies or any other non-human entity.Individuals - Basically my individual CRM system for everyone I know, and donâ€™t know.Feeds - Other generic feeds from some forums, streams, etc.</p>
