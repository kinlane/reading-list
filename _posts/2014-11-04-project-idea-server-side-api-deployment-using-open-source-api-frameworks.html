<p>As I write up a story on Magnet, another one of the API SDK service providers to emerge in the space, I cant help but evaluate what other building blocks have the potential to evovolve, and be offered as a specific service.Machine readable API definition formats like Swagger and API Blueprint make services like Apimatic and Magnet possible, and I enjoy thinking about other potential services that could be easily generated from definitions in this way.One possiblity that comes to mind is server side scaffolding, and the possibilities of generating server side scaffolding for your APIs in a variety open source API frameworks, using machine readable definitions.It is difficult to generate 100% of the server side of an API using machine readable API definitions, but you sure can go a long way in auto generating a scaffolding that will get you most of the way there.Iâ€™m picturing a whole library of every REST framework known to man (and woman), and the ability to select framework, and upload a machine readable Swagger specification, and the service generates a zip file, or publishes to Github for you.</p>
