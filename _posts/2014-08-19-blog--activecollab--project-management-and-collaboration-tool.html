<p>HTTPS as described by RFC 2818 is actually HTTP over TLS, meaning it uses the HTTP protocol on top of TLS in order to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks, protecting the communication also against eavesdropping and tampering.It makes sure that data transmitted is secured and encrypted
At activeCollab (both activecollab.com and manageprojects.com), we believe in HTTPS everywhere.Although HTTPS was resource intensive at some time in the past, this is not the case anymore.</p>
