<p>As weve said before, we use GitHub for pretty much everything at Wiredcraft; we use it to build software of course, but we also use it to interact with our clients, manage office purchases and is starting to act as our CRM (more on that in a few weeks).Recruitment is actually the main reason we initiated that trend.Over the years we used a wide range of methods to try and better organize our recruitment pipeline, from email to dedicated platforms.We tried really hard to make Streak work but never felt really at ease with the overall UX and lack of cross-browser and mobile support.Trello came the closest to satisfying our need in terms of UX but meant that we were expecting our team to split their focus between GitHub, email AND Trello.</p>
