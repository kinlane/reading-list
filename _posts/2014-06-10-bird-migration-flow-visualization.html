<p>This visualization shows one week of intense bird migration in April 2013 recorded by 5 weather radars (shown in blue) and interpolated over the entire area.This proof of concept is the result of a 5 day hackathon by the LifeWatch INBO team, hosted at the University of Amsterdam and in collaboration with the KNMI.The long-term goal of the European Network for the Radar Surveillance of Animal Movement (ENRAM) is to retrieve this kind of data at a European scale.Documentation and source code are available on GitHub.</p>
