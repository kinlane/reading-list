<p>I’ve just been involved in a twitter conversation with Nick Halstead of DataSift on Twitter.This all started when I tweeted that I thought Kwwika would be a great way of distributing data from DataSift to any web-enabled device.The conversation continued:
The main thing here for me is Nick’s point that “you just need a client-side library“.This is an assumption that a lot of services make.Services tend to offer one or a number of server APIs; maybe a REST one and now luckily we are seeing a HTTP Streaming and WebSocket support.</p>
