<p>Increasingly, we’ve noticed that our agency customers are publishing their highest quality images on social media and within database-driven multimedia galleries on their websites.These sources are curated, contain metadata, and have both thumbnails and full-size images.That’s a big improvement in quality over the images embedded within HTML pages on agencies’ websites.After some investigating, we decided we could leverage their Flickr and Instagram photos to build an image search engine that better met their needs.We gave it a plucky name and put it in production.</p>
