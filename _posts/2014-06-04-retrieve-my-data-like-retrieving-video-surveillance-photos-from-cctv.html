<p>I’m an advisor to the camera API platform, EverCam.I don’t advise the startup because I’m super excited about the opportunities for APIs for security cameras.Im involved because I believe in the Evercam team, and I want to be aware of this fast growing aspect of the Internet of things and API economy.Security cameras are not going away, and I want to help lend some critical thought to how we use security cameras, and apply APIs to help introduce transparency and accountability into this easily abused layer of our society.One of the things I learned from Evercam, is that in the UK you can request any photos of you taken on the vast closed circuit television, that is ubiquitous across the UK landscape.</p>
