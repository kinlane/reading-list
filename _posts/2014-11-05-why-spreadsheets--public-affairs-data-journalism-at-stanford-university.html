<p>As Philip Meyer said in his book, Precision Journalism:
There are two kinds of databases: those that you create yourself and those that were created by somebody else, usually without your convenience in mind.If you want to be one of those independent collectors of data – because youre paying attention to something that the government or society just isnt – then get used to using spreadsheets.Your ability to be smart at organizing information is going to be just as important as passion (if not much more important) when it comes to accomplishing your goal.Slates attempt to track gun-related homicides is one such spreadsheet-based do-it-yourself data project.For this quick walkthrough, were going to track the places we like to eat.</p>
