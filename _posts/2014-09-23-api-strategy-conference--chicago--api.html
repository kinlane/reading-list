<p>I am on a panel with Kin Lane this week @APIStrat conference, discussing (looking at the panel members, it will be more like debating) about the “Politics of APIs” and the enterprise/top industries adoption in general.Unfortunately, it is the last session on the last day of the conference, and I know the mad rush to the exit starts around that time.But we would love to see you stay and listen to the fireworks.I am interested to hear from you on specific topic(s) that you would like to see discussed on that panel.If you are attending the conference, let us catch-up.</p>
