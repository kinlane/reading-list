<p>This is a guest post from one of our sponsors.We didn’t vet them as a sponsor, or the content they were going to write.We just cashed their check on the way to the strip club this evening, and gave the a Wordpress login, so they could post their post.We aren’t in the business of understanding where the actual technology space is headed, we are in the business of telling you stories of where we want the technology space go, in the service our own selfish desires.You see we view technology blogs as a PR urinal for us to piss our stories into, so we all can pretend like they are real stories.</p>
