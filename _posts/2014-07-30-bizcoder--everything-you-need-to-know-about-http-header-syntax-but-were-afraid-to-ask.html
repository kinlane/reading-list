<p>If you use HTTP then the chances are good that you have to deal with HTTP headers.  The syntax of HTTP headers has a long and tortured history, originating from the syntax of email headers.  All too often I see headers that dont conform to the specifications.  This makes everyones job a little bit harder.  The recent releases of the HTTP specifications have done a fair amount of clarification and consolidation to make getting the syntax right.</p>
