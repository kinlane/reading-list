<p>As I’m riding the build up for APIStrat in Chicago, and preparing for I Love APIs in San Francisco, and the API 360 Summit in DC, I can’t help but think about how busy the API event scene is getting—in 2014 there are 14 separate conferences focused on the world of APIs.In the beginning there was just Gluecon, Defrag, and the Business of APIs, then 3Scale and API Evangelist got together and started planning for @APIStrat, then immediately API Days happened, Nordic APIs came on the scene, API-Crafta  grew beyond just Meetup, and before you know we have 14 separate events.I’m going to be biased here, because @APIStrat is my baby, and I’ve been involved in supporting API Days since day, so these two events will always have a special place in my heart.Even with this I believe in interoperability in the community and I am working to support all of the events equally, so if you are organizing make sure and reach out.You can find me at I Love APIs in a couple weeks in San Francisco, as well as at API 360 in Washington DC the same week, and of course @APIStrat in Chicago at the end of September, and Nordic APIs in October.</p>
