<p>Not to be left behind in the growing feud between Uber, Lyft, Sidecar and others, Hailo has launched a public API for its taxi hailing service, on the very same day Uber announced its own.The startup, which launched in 2011 in London but has since expanded to various cities across the UK, London and Canada, originally dealt in standard taxis vs.Uber’s black car focus, but has since also moved into black car, SUV and sedan transportation.The publicly accessible API follows an initial launch integration with third-party transit planning app Citymapper last month.The Citymapper integration worked similarly to how Uber now offers an in-app link to its own services in Google Maps, but didn’t require actually leaving the app to work.</p>
