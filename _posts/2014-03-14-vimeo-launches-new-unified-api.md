<p>Vimeo has announced the launch of a brand-new singular, unified Vimeo API with OAuth 2 support for authenticated API calls on videos, users, groups, channels, albums, and upload.The new singular Vimeo API, which is in open beta, replaces both of Vimeoâ€™s Advanced and Simple APIs.Vimeo developed and released the first API in March 2007.Over time the company developed a Simple API and an Advanced API.The Simple API was easy to set up and use but did not allow developers to make authenticated calls.</p>
