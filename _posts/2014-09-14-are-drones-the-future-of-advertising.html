<p>Last month, I attended a big outdoor music festival just outside of Austin, Texas.While the lineup featured indie rock heroes like Portugal.The Man and Grouplove, along with a blistering performance by Houston rap legend Bun B, there was one thing at the event guaranteed to instantly turn almost anyone in the audience’s attention away from the stage—a drone hovering just overhead.Someone at the festival brought a small, helicopter-like drone into the air over and over again.Every time it happened, a sea of heads turned skyward to watch it do, well, not a whole lot really.</p>
