<p>This post is more or less the transcript of my presentation at the Mediterranean APIdays conference in Barcelona, May 2014 and the 1st API Meetup in Athens, June 2014.The perspective that matters when designing an API is the perspective of the client.Being in the position of the client, would make you recognize that there are two important rules to validate your API design: API There are two cases that we can find ourselves building an API for: problem-solving mode In the second case, when building an API in parallel with the application, we are in the “problem-solving” mode.We are focused on building the application, not concerned about the interface our clients will interact with.What data structures and algorithms do I need for the job, and what input and output parameters are necessary to get it done?</p>
