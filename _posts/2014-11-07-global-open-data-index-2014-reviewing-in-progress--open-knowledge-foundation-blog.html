<p>October was a very exciting month for us in the Index team.We spoke to so many of you  about the Index, face to face or in the virtual world, and we got so much back from you.It was amazing for us to see how the community is pulling together not only with submissions, but also giving advice in the mailing list, translating tweets and tutorials and spreading the word of the Index around.Thank you so much for your contributions.This is the first time that we have done regional sprints, starting from the Americas in early October in AbreLATAM/ConDatos, through to our community hangout with Europe and MENA, and finishing off with Asia, Africa and Pacific.</p>
