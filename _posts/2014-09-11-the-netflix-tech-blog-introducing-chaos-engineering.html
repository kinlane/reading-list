<p>Our philosophy remains unchanged around injecting failure into production to ensure our systems are fault-tolerant.We are constantly testing our ability to survive “once in a blue moon” failures.In a sign of our commitment to this very philosophy, we want to double down on chaos aka failure-injection.We strive to mirror the failure modes that are possible in our production environment and simulate these under controlled circumstances. Our engineers are expected to write services that can withstand failures and gracefully degrade whenever necessary.</p>
