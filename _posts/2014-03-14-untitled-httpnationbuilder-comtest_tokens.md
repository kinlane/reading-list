<p>If youre looking to build an app for use by a large number of nations, you start by using OAuth2 to request tokens for accessing those nations.But if youre testing initial scripts or are using the API for a single nation, setting up that authorization flow can be a significant hurdle.To make it easier to get started, weve added the ability to create test tokens right from the control panel.Test tokens provide a simple and quick way to explore the NationBuilder API without having to use OAuth You can now harness your own nations API without having to go through a third party The tokens can be easily integrated into scripts or shell commands New applications can be built without using OAuth.They can now use a user supplied test token To create a new token, go to Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Test tokens and use the Create token button.</p>
