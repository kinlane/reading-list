<p>It has been just over three weeks since JSON resume first went public, and we are proud to announce the first official version of the specification.After much consideration we decided to launch the first version as 0.0.0, which assumes everything up until this point was conceptual and thus no backwards compatibility has been built out.Unfortunately this means that if you created a resume before this release, most parts of the ecosystem will not work for you.</p>
