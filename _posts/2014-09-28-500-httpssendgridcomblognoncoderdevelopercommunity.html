<p>I meet a lot of people, from all over the planet.I’ve met an especially large and diverse group of people over the last 3+ years, within my role at SendGrid.Most people I meet are operating within a world similar to mine, professionally speaking: think startups, tech, [insert geeky buzzword here], etc.I’m not a developer, yet time and again people assume I am.And they assume that you have to be able, to code to be part of a developer community.</p>
