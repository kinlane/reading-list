<p>I was invited to give a keynote talk to computing students at the Imperial College during the kick-off event for their summer group projects, aimed at the development of an innovative web or mobile-based app.I was asked to talk about the specifics of software engineering for mobile.Based on this, we are launching a six part blog post series to summarize the content of this talk.Because my audience were all computing students, I wanted to present content that goes beyond “just” technological aspects – assuming this is stuff they know already anyway or can easily figure out.I thought about key elements that perhaps don’t guarantee success but could at least increase the chances of launching a successful mobile app or product.</p>
