<p>So, when you wake up in the morning as an agent of the world of IT, you never know what is going to hit you in the face.Two nights ago, the fun went by the name Heartbleed.It is somewhat an appropriate name as the vulnerability has to do with a heartbeat signal used in OpenSSL (commonly illustrated by that little tiny “lock-icon” you see next to “https” in a website’s URL).This particular bug exposes private information in the form of a block of memory, meaning that if a bad guy knew of the vulnerability and where to look he could easily capture log-in credentials and otherwise sensitive information from users.What makes this bug so scary is that everyone trusted this protocol, or standard, for encrypting and delivering data.</p>
