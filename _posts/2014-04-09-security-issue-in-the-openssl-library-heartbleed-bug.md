<p>As many of you have probably heard a serious security issue (dubbed the “heartbleed bug”) was found in the OpenSSL library yesterday.This is a very serious issue as this library is used to encrypt a large percentage of the Internet’s traffic, including web and email.The security issue could allow anybody to access parts of the encrypted traffic as well as the secret keys used to encrypt that traffic.What we have done As soon as we were made aware of the issue we started updating the OpenSSL version used by our various systems and we replaced the SSL certificates that we were using.As of now all of our systems have been patched and all of our SSL certificates have been replaced.</p>
