<p>If you really want to blow end users away, or give your team up to the millisecond analytics, you need to drink from the data firehose.What’s this mean?Drinking from a data firehose is streaming and publishing realtime streams of data, whether it be weather reports, Tweets, RSS feeds, or stock quotes, updated as they change.To do this, you need a robust and fast data stream network to transfer the data packets through, presenting it to your end users in realtime.Luckily for you, we’re continuing to expand our demo realtime data streams that can be plugged into your PubNub applications.</p>
