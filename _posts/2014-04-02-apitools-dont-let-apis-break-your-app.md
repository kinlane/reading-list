<p>This API driven development is driven by the need to have Applications accessed on many mobile devices, from many different places, and most importantly, use different data sources from different places.APIs provide a rich tool box of functionality that can be quickly stitched together to make something work.The downside to this new “Development Nirvana”, is that you can’t avoid your apps depending on those APIs.No matter if they are backends for your mobile app, 3rd party APIs or internal systems, if APIs fail or change behaviour, your App risks blowing up.To deal with this App-APIs dependency you need of staying in absolute control of the API traffic your Apps generate.</p>
