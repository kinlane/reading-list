<p>InfoQ asked Kin Lane, the leading API evangelist, to share his views on open API designs and on what led him to launch the API Commons initiative last November with Steven Wilmott.After receiving positive reactions, Kin is even more convinced of the importance of open sourcing API designs and shaping common patterns from which all API designers can benefit.He explains how translation and interoperability between the emerging API description languages matters, and how an open internet culture should prevent API Commons from doing the same mistakes as past initiatives like UDDI.InfoQ: Hi Kin, can you briefly introduce yourself and explain what led you to launch the API Commons initiative last November?I am the API Evangelist, not for any specific API, but APIs in general.</p>
