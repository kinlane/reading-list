<p>I’m working through my recent notes, and engaging in more conversations with knowledgeable folks, on the topic of API copyright.One recent conversation was with Mike Linksvayer (@mlinksva), who pointed me to his very informative blog post, where he discusses API copyright.One thing Mike says, which really summarizes something I feel strongly about, but havent been able to articulate, was: In the context of APIs, default policy should be that independent implementation of an API never require permission from the API’s designer, previous implementer, or other rights holder.” The Mike brings it home, with a sobering view on why this is critical to entire industry: Without such a default policy of permission-free innovation, interoperability and competition will suffer, and the API community invites late and messy regulation at other levels intending to protect consumers from resulting lock-in.” Mike provides a very precise explanation of why the openness, interoperability, re-use, and a permission free layer in the API stack needs to exist, without legal obstacles.</p>
