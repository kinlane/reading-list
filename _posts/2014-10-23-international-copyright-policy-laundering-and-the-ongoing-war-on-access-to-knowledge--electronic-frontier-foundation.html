<p>How is it possible that someone could face years in prison for sharing an academic paper online?How did we arrive at such extreme criminal punishments for accessing knowledge and information?Well, this has been long in the making.We got here because Big Content interests have dominated secretive, back-room copyright negotiations over several decades, resulting in laws that are increasingly restricting our speech, and our ability to comment, control, re-use, and access knowledge, culture, and the devices that we own.This is especially relevant for Open Access Week, which is all about making publicly-funded information and knowledge available free of licensing restrictions.</p>
