 Comics I enjoy:
Three Word Phrase,         Oglaf (nsfw),         SMBC,         Dinosaur Comics,         A Softer World,         Buttersafe,         Perry Bible Fellowship,         Questionable Content,         Buttercup Festival 
Warning: this comic occasionally contains strong language (which may be unsuitable for children), unusual humor (which may be unsuitable for adults), and advanced mathematics (which may be unsuitable for liberal-arts majors).We did not invent the algorithm.</p>
