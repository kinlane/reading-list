<p>A while ago I read the blog post Ranging Near and Far by Scott Sauyet.On Echo JS, Scott titled a link to this blog “Choosing simple APIs over flexible ones”.This title suggests that you have to choose between either simple or flexible APIs, which is a false dilemma.This got me thinking: What makes a good API?because of it being more flexible.</p>
