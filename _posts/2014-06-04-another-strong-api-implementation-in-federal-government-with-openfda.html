<p>I am really impressed with the quality of API deployments coming out of the federal government recently.I wrote about the FBOpen API from 18F a couple months ago, and the latest is the OpenFDA API from the Food &amp; Drug Administration.Iâ€™ve been watching the rollout of the API from behind the scenes for a while now, but with all my travel and speaking I havent had time to write about or participate, but now that theyve officially launch publicly, I wanted to help showcase what theyve been up to at the FDA.Meaningful First Impression When you first land on OpenFDA, you immediately understand what it does, thanks to the interactive visual on the homepage introducing OpenFDA, letting you know that it contains more than 3 million adverse drug event reports, with frequently reported indications for drug use among women, 55 to 90.This simple simple description, combined with an interactive visual that demonstrates the value contained within this government API resource, leaves a meaningful first impression upon arrival.</p>
