<p>As this report goes to print, a tragedy is unfolding in Ferguson, Missouri, where Michael Brown, an unarmed African-American teenager was fatally shot by Darren Wilson, a White police officer.In the months to come, federal and local investigations will seek to determine what happened during the encounter between police officer and civilian.Consider how differently these investigations might have gone had Officer Wilson used a body-worn camera to record his interaction with Mr.Brown.With strict measures to ensure proper protocols are in place, such cameras can be a powerful tool for police oversight and accountability, as well as to address longstanding deficiencies in police practice that disproportionately impact communities of color.</p>
