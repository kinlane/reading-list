<p>QuiQui flying drone prescription delivery service launched in San Francisco A new startup has launched a drone service in San Francisco to deliver prescribed medications to residents doors within 15 minutes - including medical marijuana.QuiQui (pronounced Kwi-Key) operates 24 hours-a-day and users only need to pay for the cost of their medication, plus a $1 (60p) delivery charge.We cant ring the bell, but well meet you outside, says the companys website, which explains that it has decided to launch the drone service in the Mission district of San Francisco as the lack of tall buildings and generally flat landscape makes it much easier for the flying drones to get around.The company is working with local pharmacies in San Francisco to deliver your prescriptions and says it choseÂ pharmacy items because theyre typically very small and easy to transport.Carrying larger items would not be commercially viable it says.</p>
