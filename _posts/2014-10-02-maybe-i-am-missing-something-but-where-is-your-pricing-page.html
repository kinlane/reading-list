<p>I was doing some research on travel and transportation APIs over the last couple of weeks, and one of the developer portals I was looking at was one of the enterprise leaders in the space, the Sabre Dev Network.I really like the overall implementation from Sabre, except for one thing.There is no pricing page for the Sabre Dev Network.;-( The only place you find a mention of pricing is in the FAQ page, where it says:
We have a number of different pricing options for our services.Whether you are a company just starting out or an established travel provider, we have pricing options that will fit your business needs.</p>
