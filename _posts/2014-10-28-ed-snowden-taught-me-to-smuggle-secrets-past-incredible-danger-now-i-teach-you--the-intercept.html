<p>Late on the evening of January 11, 2013, someone sent me an interesting email.It was encrypted, and sent from the sort of anonymous email service that smart people use when they want to hide their identity.Sitting at the kitchen table in the small cottage where I lived in Berkeley with my wife and two cats, I decrypted it.The anonymous emailer wanted to know if I could help him communicate securely with Laura Poitras, the documentary filmmaker who had repeatedly cast a critical eye on American foreign policy.I didn’t know it at the time, but I had just been contacted by Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency contractor who was then preparing a momentous leak of government data.</p>
