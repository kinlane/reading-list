<p>In September 2011, in response to the Office of Management and Budget releasing a list of all federal executive domains, I built a small tool called Site Inspector and created a quick analysis of the technology and capabilities that power each federal domain.Nearly three years later, I resurrected that tool, albiet a bit smarter, and, using the latest list, thought I’d take a look at how things have changed in the time since.Efforts like the Digital Strategy and Open Data Policy have surely moved the needle, right?RIGHT?www.</p>
