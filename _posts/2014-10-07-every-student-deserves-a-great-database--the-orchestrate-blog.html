<p>Somewhere in a dorm room, someone is tuning a database.They’re handling indexing conflicts and trying to figure out sharding.All of these struggles are in the name of “learning,” but much of the effort is misplaced.Their time is better spent creating something new.Those students, banging their heads against solved problems in their residence hall, deserve a great database.</p>
