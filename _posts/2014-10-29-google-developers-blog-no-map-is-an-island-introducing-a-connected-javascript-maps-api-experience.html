<p>Cross-posted from the Google Geo Developers blog 
 Our digital lives are increasingly connected.We research on our laptops, look up directions on our phones and even navigate with our watches.And by creating maps unique to each user and offering features such as saved places, Google Maps has been making it easier to continue these tasks as we move from device to device.However, although maps embedded from Google Maps are now built uniquely for every Google user, most of the now two million active sites and apps using the Maps APIs are still islands.When I look for a place to eat on Zagat, I canâ€™t see how far away it is from work.</p>
