<p>We held the first in a series of JavaScript talks at our Los Gatos, Calif.headquarters on March 19th.Our own Jafar Husain shared how weâ€™re using the Reactive Extensions (Rx) library to build responsive UIs across our device experiences.The talk goes into detail on how Netflix uses Rx to: Declaratively build complex events out of simple events (ex.drag and drop) Coordinate and sequence multiple Ajax requests Reactively update the UI in response to data changes Eliminate memory leaks caused by neglecting to unsubscribe from events There was a great turnout for the event and the audience asked some really good questions.</p>
