<p>Once upon a time, photos were something you held.You kept them safe in an album or shoebox, and it was easy to relive those moments with friends and family.Today, new apps and devices have made it easier than ever to take photos, but there’s no longer a single home for all your life’s memories.We’d like you to meet Carousel: a gallery for all the photos and videos from your life.It combines the photos in your Dropbox with the photos on your phone, and automatically backs up new ones as you take them.</p>
