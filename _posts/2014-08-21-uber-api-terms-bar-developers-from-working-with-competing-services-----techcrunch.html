<p>So a quick side note that wasn’t really mentioned in today’s earlier coverage around Uber’s big API announcement this morning: The on-demand transportation company will bar developers who are interested in using its API from integrating with competing services.Uber apparently declined to go into detail about the exclusive terms of its API when it spoke with the press before the announcement.The Wall Street Journal reported that “different financial arrangements are being made with different partners,” but makes it no mention of exclusivity.At Re/code, meanwhile, Kara Swisher wrote, “It is also not clear if the deals with its initial partners are exclusive — meaning Uber demanded that rivals like Lyft not be offered to a partner’s users and integrated into its app.”
 If you check out the Uber API’s Terms of Use, however, they expressly forbid developers from adding competitive services to their applications.</p>
