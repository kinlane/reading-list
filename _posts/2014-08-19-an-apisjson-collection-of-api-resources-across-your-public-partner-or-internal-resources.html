<p>APIs.json was designed to be a versatile API discovery format, not just a format for public API discovery via search engines like APIs.io.An APIs.json is meant to be a machine readable index of APIs within a single developer hub, providing information on the API endpoints as well as any other supporting resources--there is no reason that all of this canâ€™t also be applied in a private setting.</p>
