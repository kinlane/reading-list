<p>When we first conceived API Commons, we were a little fuzzy about which of Creative Commons licenses API providers should apply to their API definitions.As long as a provider took a stance on API copyright around your API definitions, applied a Creative Commons license, we considered an API “in the commons”.As time has evolved, and weve had time to reflect on the decision that the Federal Circuit Court handed down in the Oracle v Google case, weve adjusted our vision of what Creative Commons licenses should  be applied to an API, and still be considered as part of the API Commons.We feel pretty strongly that API definitions have to remain openly licensed, re-usable, even for commercial purposes.In a perfect world we wouldnt have to apply copyright at all, but in light of the Oracle v Google case we should take a proactive stance, and apply the copyright license that make the most sense.</p>
