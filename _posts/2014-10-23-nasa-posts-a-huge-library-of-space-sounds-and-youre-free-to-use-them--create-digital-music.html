<p>Space is the place.Again.And SoundCloud is now a place you can find sounds from the US government space agency, NASA.In addition to the requisite vocal clips (“Houston, we’ve had a problem” and “The Eagle has landed”), you get a lot more.There are rocket sounds, the chirps of satellites and equipment, lightning on Jupiter, interstellar plasma and radio emissions.</p>
