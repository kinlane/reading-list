<p>Bespoke Post has a literal ice-breaker for its new hires--by asking them to make fancy cocktails for the team.Back in 2012, when Bespoke Post was just a startup with handful of people, it began as many new businesses do: with conversations around beer.The gang met for a weekly happy hour at Lolita Bar on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, which offered pints of better-than-average brews for $3.(The bar has since gone out of business.) Like at a lot of companies founded by young folks--like a lot of companies, period--booze found its way into Bespoke Postâ€™s DNA early.</p>
