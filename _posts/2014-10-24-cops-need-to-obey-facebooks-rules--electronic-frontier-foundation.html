<p>Facebook scolded the Drug Enforcement Administration this week after learning that a narcotics agent had impersonated a user named Sondra Arquiett on the social network in order to communicate and gather intelligence on suspects.In a strongly worded letter to DEA head Michele Leonhart, Facebook’s Chief Security Officer Joe Sullivan reiterated that not only did the practice explicitly violate the site’s terms of service, but threatened Facebook’s trust-based social ecosystem.Sullivan writes:
So far, it is unclear whether the DEA has responded, although the US Department of Justice has independently launched an investigation into the practice.We commend Facebook for holding the agency accountable.But we also think Facebook should go further in protecting users and the integrity of its services.</p>
