<p>A lot of people ask what a Developer Evangelist does, and the answers can vary a bit depending on which company they work for, and how the team is placed within the organization.Regardless of the tactics in place, all of them are based on a few core principles of Developer Relations, which I call the 3 C’s: Community, Code, and Content.If you don’t have a way to reach developers, your Developer Relations program isn’t worth much.At SendGrid, our main strategy is “give first”–the more successful start-ups there are, the better off everyone is.As Tim has said before, a personal connection is worth more than a click.</p>
