<p>Software developer Evan Cordell initiated a debate about how the hypermedia constraint of REST is at odds with common web APIs requirements in the API-Craft mailing list a few weeks ago.In discussing his RESTistential crisis, Cordell noted that the REST style has finally started to reveal its best hidden secret, the hypermedia constraint, after years of debates and practice.While perfectly adapted to human-driven interaction as demonstrated by the Web, there appears to be growing concerns within the web API community about its usefulness for programmable web APIs in general.He started the conversation with a description of REST and hypermedia limitations when applied to domain-specific web APIs, then considers the need for alternate architecture styles, taking the best of REST but replacing some constraints to obtain different benefits, such as efficient and reliable machine-to-machine communication.The main concerns cited mention the various ways to deal with changes of an interface over a long period of time.</p>
