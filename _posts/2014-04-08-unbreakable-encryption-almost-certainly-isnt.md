<p>Researchers at Lancaster University, UK have taken a hint from the way the human lungs and heart constantly communicate with each other, to devise an innovative, highly flexible encryption algorithm that they claim cant be broken using the traditional methods of cyberattack.Information can be encrypted with an array of different algorithms, but the question of which method is the most secure is far from trivial.Such algorithms need a key to encrypt and decrypt information; the algorithms typically generate their keys using a well-known set of rules that can only admit a very large, but nonetheless finite number of possible keys.This means that in principle, given enough time and computing power, prying eyes can always break the code eventually.The researchers, led by Dr.</p>
