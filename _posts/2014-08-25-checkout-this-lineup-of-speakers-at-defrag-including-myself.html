<p>Check out this lineup of the first round speakers at Defrag this year!I recently got an email from the event queen Kimberly Norlin, and Im pretty stoked about some of the people I will be sharing the stage with in Colorado this year.My presentation will be about containers and APIs, borrowing from John Sheehan, when he said containers will do for APis what APIs do for companies.Which is a pretty prescient comment, but not surprising from someone like John is on the leading edge with his API integration startup Runscope.</p>
