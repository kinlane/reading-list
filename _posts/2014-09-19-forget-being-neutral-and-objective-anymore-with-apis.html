<p>I commonly use the statement that I don’t work for any company, and I strive to be a neutral voice in the industry.After four years, I’m going to be ditching that rhetoric, so if you hear me say it, call me out and say bullshit!First of all I dont believe the concept anymore, and I feel like it was bullshit to begin with, and as the API space is picking up momentum, I cant help but push some technologies, products, and services over others.I’m writing this post to seal the deal in my own memory, which is the primary reason I blog.First of all, the companies that sponsor and support me, I cant help but endorse what they offer, not just because they give me money, but also the fact that they have a decent product, otherwise I wouldn’t be associated with them.</p>
