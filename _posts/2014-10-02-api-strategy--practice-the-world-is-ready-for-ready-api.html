<p>Last week I had the pleasure of attending API Strategy & Practice.The conference offered great content with heavy-hitting speakers and some great technical sessions, but most notably for me I was excited to formally announce Ready!API to the world.  For those not familiar with our gripping news that SmartBear has been working on for months… we have revamped SoapUI Pro and are announcing the launch of the new Ready!API platform.</p>
