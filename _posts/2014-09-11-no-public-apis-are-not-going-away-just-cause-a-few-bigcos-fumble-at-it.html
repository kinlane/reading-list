<p>I saw another story about whether or not public APIs are going away, which is another story in a fairly long line of stories I’m seeing lately from enterprise outlets about whether or not the demise of Netflix, ESPN, and now Aetna means public APIs are a bad idea, unsustainable and now will be going away—proving enterprise API architects right that an SOA is the way to go.If you are looking at the bigger API picture, the answer to this question is clearly no.Amazon, Salesforce, Twilio, and many other public APIs with straightforward business models are doing just fine.Just because a handful of companies who never quite had a business model, and never really gave their API efforts  the resources they needed to be successful, doesnt mean that public APIs are a bad idea.Looking through my list of 2500+ APIs I track on, I can point to numerous other APIs that are about to shutter, which has nothing to do with the fact that they are public, and everything to do with not having the right business and political building blocks for their API.</p>
