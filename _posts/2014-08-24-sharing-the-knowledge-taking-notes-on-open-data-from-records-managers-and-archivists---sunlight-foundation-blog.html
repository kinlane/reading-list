<p>More than 2,300 records managers and archivists from around the world gathered in Washington, DC, last week to talk about public records and managing the massive amount of new information being created by technology.Discussions at the conference made it clear that the open data community can benefit from connecting with and learning from people in the records management and archival communities.We share many of the same challenges and goals with determining how governments can best share information and preserve access to it.Last weeks conference, Archives*Records 2014: Ensuring Access, was a joint meeting of the Council of State Archivists, Society of American Archivists, and National Association of Government Archives & Records Administrators.Topics discussed ranged from copyright law to appraising records for determining what to keep permanently, but some of the conversations most relevant to those interested in open data centered around electronic records and metadata.</p>
