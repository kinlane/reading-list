<p>The benefit of an HTTP API would be easier access via tools that dont support the PostgreSQL protocol, such as curl, web browsers, new programming languages, etc.Itd also be attractive to the NoSQL crowd, who often want *simple* access.Particularly so when combined with PostgreSQLs new built-in JSON types, which could be returned in a JSON format result unescaped as a directly nested child object.HTTP+REST is much easier to use from mobile aps.Currently if you want to write, say, an Android app that talks to PostgreSQL you need to do it via a web API midlayer you host somewhere.</p>
