<p>The CIA says that it will no longer use vaccination campaigns as a cover for intelligence programs, as it did several years ago when investigating Osama bin Ladens potential presence in his Abbottabad compound, reports Yahoo News.The agency saw backlash after details of the operation were revealed, as those programs already faced opposition in key regions and began to see even less acceptance as well as deadly attacks on health workers following the revelation.The CIAs director apparently implemented the ban in August of last year, but it was only revealed in a letter last week in a letter sent to deans of 12 public health schools who had joined together to condemn the use of health programs for covert operations.This CIA policy applies worldwide.The letter attempts to fully distance the CIA from vaccination campaigns, explaining that it would not make use of the programs or their workers.</p>
