<p>In my monitoring of the API space, when I started seeing a large number of blog posts, tweets, companies, and other elements I track on get tagged with the same tag over and over, I take notice.My blogging, CRM, and news curation system all have their own tag cloud interface for the week, showing which tags have been applied--so if a tag gets heavy usage, I know it.Over the last couple of years, Ive spun up new research into other areas within the world of APIs, beyond my core design, deployment, management, evangelism, discovery, and integration research.I created separate buckets beyond just provide and consume to track on these new areas, called trends, opportunities, and priorities.In 2014 it is beginning to seem like each of my trend research areas are getting baked directly into API platforms, ranging from real-time features with Firebase, to reciprocity by default using Zapier.</p>
