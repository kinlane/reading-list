<p>For the last nine years, Nicholas Felton--who you may know best for inspiring the Facebook timeline or creating the life-logging app Reporter--has been recording some aspect of almost every moment of his life.And each year, he turns this data into a elegant, printed book that visualizes the year called The Feltron Report.(See 2011 here and 2012 here.)  
His 2013 report was released yesterday, and while his past efforts have tracked minutia like beers drank and places on the globe visited, this time, Felton was even more ambitious, tracking every bit of communication--be it a spoken or nonverbal acknowledgement, SMS, Facebook message, telephone call, email, or the paper stuff.Thatâ€™s 94,842 interactions containing 7,673,242 words in all, requiring an painstaking amount of work just to archive.</p>
