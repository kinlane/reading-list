<p>Since 2007, Sean O’Sullivan’s SOSventures has been investing in Carma (formerly Avego) to promote carpooling in various markets throughout the world.Now, the firm is looking to invest in the developer community as a way to help make real-time ride-sharing happen, through the release of an API and a whopping $2.5 million in prize money to developers who use the API to drive carpooling adoption.Carma provides a platform and mobile app that is designed to help users find nearby commuters that they can share rides with.It’s not a new idea, but the folks at Carma want to set themselves apart from a new breed of so-called “ride-sharing” startups that provide a way for users to find rides in an on-demand fashion.</p>
