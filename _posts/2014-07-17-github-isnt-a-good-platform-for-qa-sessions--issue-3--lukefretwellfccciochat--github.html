<p>@lukefretwell GitHub is not exactly a great platform for these sort of things.Look at the turnout you had.Ive never heard of these chats happening before, and doing them in an obscure platform like GitHub just leads to failure.Perhaps you were simply targeting developers in these QA sessions, but judging by the questions that were asked and answered, a sense of a broader audience comes to mind.Frankly, youd have a better turnout going to places like reddit.</p>
