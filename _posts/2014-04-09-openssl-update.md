<p>On Monday April 7th OpenSSL released an update to address CVE-2014-0160 (aka Heartbleed).This was a vulnerability in the popular cryptographic library that is used to secure many major websites.It affected nearly two thirds of web servers, including sites like Google, Twitter, and Yahoo. Mashape has implemented the update and is no longer vulnerable to potential Heartbleed exploits.We’ve also reissued our SSL certificates, changed internal passwords, and changed private keys.</p>
