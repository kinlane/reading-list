<p>Illustration: Getty I wake up at four to some old-timey dubstep spewing from my pillows.The lights are flashing.My alarm clock is blasting Skrillex or Deadmau5 or something, I donâ€™t know.I never listened to dubstep, and in fact the entire genre is on my banned list.You see, my house has a virus again.</p>
