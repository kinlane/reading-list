<p>Iâ€™ve been a outspoken advocate for more open source API management tooling, for some time now.Im sensitive to the fact that startups have to make money in the API space, but in my opinion a certain layer of the API space needs to remain open and interoperable for this all to work, and I feel that open source tools are an important variable in this equation.When I last checked into what was available in the space, there really wasnt much, so in 2014 I figured Id take another look.Originally there is just one player on the space who was completely open source, and that is WSO2:
  API management is just one tool in the massive open source catalog that WSO2 brings to the table.The company provides a number of open source tools including identity & authentication, ESB, data  and API management solutions.</p>
