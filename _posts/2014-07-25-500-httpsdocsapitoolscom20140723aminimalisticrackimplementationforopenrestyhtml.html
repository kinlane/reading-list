<p>A minimalistic rack implementation for Openresty Published on 23 Jul 2014 by Enrique Rack APItools is an intelligent proxy.By default, it only passes the requests and responses it receives, storing them in a Redis database.However, we wanted to empower our users to do more.We wanted them to be able to add headers, or change the body of a request (amongst other things).We also wanted these pieces of functionality to be encapsulated in discrete pieces, so they could be moved around, stored and shared.</p>
