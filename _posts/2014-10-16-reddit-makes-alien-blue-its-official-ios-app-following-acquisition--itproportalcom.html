According to TechCrunch, rumours of the purchase have been circulating for the past few weeks or so, but despite this, reddit is refusing to disclose the terms of the deal.Perhaps more bizarrely, reddit seem hesitant to refer to Alien Blue as its official iOS reader, with the company claiming it has no plans to change the name of the app as a result of the purchase.Ellen Pao, reddits head of strategic partnerships, said that the decision not to make wholesale changes to the app reflects the sites policy of putting its users first.</p>
