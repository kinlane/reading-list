<p>As part of our commitment to education, and in addition to our recent Heavybit blog launch, we’re launching a library for cloud infrastructure and developer startups.Heavybit’s nine month program teaches technical co-founders and developer-facing startups what they might not know -- namely, go-to-market strategy, ops strategy, building a sales team and managing marketing/PR.The companies building cloud infrastructure &amp; developer services face a unique set of challenges and our curriculum is meant to get them up to speed.The library includes videos from our weekly members-only Speaker Series featuring execs from Dropbox, Twilio, Salesforce and New Relic.In the coming weeks well also include useful articles from advisors, startups and members.</p>
