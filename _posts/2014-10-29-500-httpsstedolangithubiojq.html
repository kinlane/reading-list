<p>jq is like 
sed
 for JSON data – you can use it to slice and filter and map and transform structured data with the same ease that 
sed
awk
grep
 and friends let you play with text.jq is written in portable C, and it has zero runtime dependencies.You can download a single binary, 
scp
 it to a far away machine, and expect it to work.jq can mangle the data format that you have into the one that you want with very little effort, and the program to do so is often shorter and simpler than you’d expect.Go read the tutorial for more, or the manual for way more.</p>
