<p>by Jonathan Zittrain 
In the late Nineteenth Century the Spanish Marquis de Olivart — a writer, ambassador, professor, and sometime foreign minister — had amassed an enviable collection of some fourteen thousand international law books.He then gave the collection to the Spanish government, moved, he said, “by a patriotism that was as ardent as it was sterile.”
The government didn’t stick to the terms of the gift in maintaining the collection, and the disillusioned Marquis managed to claw it back.Word got around that it might be for sale.The Harvard Law School Librarian lobbied to put in a bid — one that would cost the school nearly every spare cent it had.</p>
