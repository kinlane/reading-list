<p>In any message format design its a good idea to make things that can change be data elements, rather than structural elements.Changing structural elements breaks things, data elements provide evolvability.Phone and e-mail fields have a lot of variance.People have different types of phones, emails and they dont necessarily limit them to work and personal.Making such assumptions is wrong.</p>
