<p>This month we are releasing several new features to enhance your development experience: the lifetime Dev Center account, and the new Dev Center Benefits program.I’d like to encourage you to visit the Dev Center and take advantage of the new benefits available to you.We also continue to invest in our advertising platform for apps, and I’d like to share several new features and capabilities, whose early results show that ad revenue in Windows Phone apps is increasing at a faster pace than before.As we continue to execute on the vision to integrate the Windows and Windows Phone developer experiences, we have taken another step by moving to a one-time lifelong Dev Center registration fee.Starting this week, Windows Dev Center requires only a one-time registration payment, which grants developers the ability to submit apps to both the Windows Store and Windows Phone Store, with no annual renewal fee.</p>
