<p>I was taking a look through the NewsCred API yesterday and there was a parameter I have seen before, but find interesting, and wanted to share with you.It was a field called query_fields, which you could include the fields you wished to have searched, using a keyword provided in the parameter “q”.You often see a parameter which determines which fields I get back with my response, but I like the concept of have a parameter to choose which fields I want searched in the first place.I think it is a simple, parameter based way to give developers more control over their API calls, in a way that will make sense to a wide audience.Now I need to figure out a way to aggregate these simple little API design tricks and make them available to readers when they are designing their APIs.</p>
