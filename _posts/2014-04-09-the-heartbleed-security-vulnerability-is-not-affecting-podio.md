<p>Im Florian and I make sure Podio is always available and as fast as possible, wherever in the world youre working from.I also think the Internet is a series of tubes.We want to reassure everyone using Podio that the Heartbleed bug – a recently discovered high priority security vulnerability – is not affecting Podio.On April 7, 2014 information was released about a new vulnerability (CVE-2014-0160) in OpenSSL, the cryptography library that powers the vast majority of private communication across the Internet.This library is key for maintaining privacy between servers and clients, and confirming that Internet servers are who they say they are.</p>
