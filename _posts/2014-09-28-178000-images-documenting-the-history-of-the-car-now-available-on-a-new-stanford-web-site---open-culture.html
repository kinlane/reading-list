<p>The Revs Program at Stanford, dedicated to producing scholarship about the past, present and future of the automobile, recently advanced its cause by launching a new website featuring 178,000 images of cars.Divided into 12 collections, the Revs Digital Library features lots of race cars, and then some more race cars.But there are some more everyday models too — like the Beetle, Citroën, Corvette, Mini and even the Gremlin. You won’t find, however, any trace of the much-maligned Edsel.The images came to Stanford as a gift from the  Revs Institute  for Automotive Research, located in Naples, Florida.</p>
