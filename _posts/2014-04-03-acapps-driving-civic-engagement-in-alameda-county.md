<p>At their first acApps hackathon, Alameda County brought together civic innovators and developers alike to create smart apps to help improve services.Many ideas were born of that hackathon, including AC BookIt!, a clever mobile app that allows users to scan the code on any book to find out if that book was available in the Alameda County library system.Users can connect their library card to the app and, if the book is available, the app will reserve it and give driving directions to the library branch holding it.  Innovation like this is pretty par for the course for the citizens of Alameda County.</p>
