<p>We just wrapped up the 4th edition of @APIStrat in Chicago last week, and once again I’m very happy with the way things went, as 400+ folks gathered to discuss APIs.The event had the right tone, and I got the usual flood of comments from attendees, speakers, and sponsors about what a great experience the event was.I would love to take credit, but all of the responsibility goes to 3Scale for making it happen.3Scale takes all the risk, and their rockstar team makes the event a reality—I just help get folks to the conference, contribute ideas to the schedule, present, and MC as much of the event as I possibly can.@APIStrat has been helping move forward the conversation in the API space for two years now, starting with New York and San Francisco in 2013, and now Amsterdam and Chicago in 2014, all made possible because of 3Scales investment.</p>
