<p>In the digital age, being a user of any service, is an endorsement, and vote about whether or not an online service is good or bad.Just as we do in the real world, and shopping at stores that reflect our views, we need to make sure and do the same online.Each time I am frustrated with a service because of their disregard for privacy or security, or their heavy handed terms of service, their exploitation of user data, or D) all the above, Iâ€™m going to blog about it.After blogging about it, and things do not change over time, I will weight the pros and cons of a service, and vote with my user account.Up this week is Quora.</p>
