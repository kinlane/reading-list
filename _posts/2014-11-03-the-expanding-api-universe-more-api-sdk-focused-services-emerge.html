<p>Im beginning to see just about every building  block in the design, deployment, management, and integration of APIs evolve into individual startups who are looking to provide services to the API sector.I wrote about Apimatic a few months back and how they are focused on generating high quality SDKs from machine readable API formats like Swagger and API Blueprint.This last week I was introduced to another provider, Magnet, and their rest2mobile service which will “generate mobile native code for REST services”.Magnet has chosen to focus exclusively on mobile SDKs, where Apimatic is focused on web and mobile SDKs.I consider web SDKs one building block, and mobile SDKs another building block, and companies should evaluate their need for them side-by-side, something service providers like Apimatic and Magnet are looking to assist with.</p>
