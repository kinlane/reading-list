<p>The UK has sent the worlds open data movement up a wrong turn, fear its greatest advocates, by easing restrictions on profits that can be earned from the sale of public data.Their fears were roused by a reboot of regulations that will make it easier for public bodies to sell data.This was contrary to the campaign promises of the coalition governments Conservative leadership, who said they would make public bodies publish their databases as open data.Public data was to be put in public hands for the public good.The new rules, to be drafted in December, will permit those quasi-public bodies who hold the most valuable public data to continue selling it for profit.</p>
