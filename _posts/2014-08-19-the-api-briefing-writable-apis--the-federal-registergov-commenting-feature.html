<p>Up till now, all the APIs that have been written about in The API Briefing were read-only APIs.That means that information is only one way: from the API to the user or app.These APIs do allow limited interactivity in that the database behind the API can be searched, but the existing data cannot be edited, or new data added to the database.There are some federal government APIs that are writable.Users or apps can use writable APIs to add information or edit information in the API’s database.</p>
