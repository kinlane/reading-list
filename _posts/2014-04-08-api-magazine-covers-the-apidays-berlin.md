<p>I am interested in mobile apps in a very broad sense.I like to ponder about: Stuff I collect here sparked my interest and is pretty random but defines me.Everything presented here is my own view.The APIDays are a global tour covering six cities: Barcelona, Berlin, Moscow, Paris, San Francisco and Tokyo.APIDays is also vendor-independent and genuinely wants to drive to API space forward and covers a wide range of topics such as scalability, versioning, developer experience, testing, mobile, security or business models.</p>
