<p>The quality of a voice call is the critical element when it comes to the caller’s experience and one of the largest issues impacting IP voice is audio latency.Today at Enterprise Connect we released our Global Low Latency (GLL) architecture to Twilio Client’s WebRTC capabilities.  In addition we have enhanced our  functionalities for enterprise-level conferencing.Twilio Client enables VoIP calling to browser-based and mobile applications, leveraging WebRTC for real-time communications and connecting to legacy SIP and PSTN networks.We extended our GLL architecture to Twilio Client’s WebRTC which intelligently routes your call to the nearest Twilio datacenter, significantly reducing audio latency.</p>
