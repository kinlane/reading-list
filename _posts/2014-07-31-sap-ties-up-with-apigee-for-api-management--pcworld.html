<p>SAP will resell software from Apigee in a move to help customers and partners build mobile applications, products and services that securely tap data from SAP systems.The deal will result in a product called SAP API Management, a rebadged version of Apigee’s Edge platform, which will be available in both on-premises form and on SAP’s Hana Cloud Platform, according to an announcement Thursday.The Apigee product’s approach should calm the nerves of conservative SAP system administrators, who may be resistant to allowing external applications to call into critical back-end systems directly, said Joav Bally, chief product manager for Gateway and SAP API Management.He compared Apigee’s platform to a bouncer at a nightclub.“It decides who gets into the club or not,” he said.</p>
