<p>I’ve been following the evolution of Docker since shortly after the initial release of the project in March 2013.My earliest Docker-related memory, albeit a vague one, was of being briefed by Solomon Hykes, the project’s creator, at Cloud Connect Santa Clara the month after the project’s release.I mention all this only to say that I’ve sat in on my fair share of Docker presentations and briefings, including several at Docker-the-company’s recently held, first-ever DockerCon.It was with this experience, or perhaps in spite of this experience, that I sat in on a Docker presentation by Nicholas Weaver, principal cloud architect for Intel’s Cloud Platforms Group, at the Intel Developer Forum last week.Suffice it to say that my hour was well spent; Nick’s talk, “Bare-metal, Docker Containers, and Virtualization: The Growing Choices for Cloud Applications” was perhaps the best I’ve heard thus far on Docker and containers, and I learned quite a bit.</p>
