<p>If you follow Twilio blog or Twitter account you can always find a good API story from the API leader.It also makes me happy to see trends I’m seeing from other provider re-enforced by the API heavyweight.This time is providing spreadsheet integration with common API resources, like Twilio SMS.Twilio has a pretty slick tool they call TwilioSheet that allows you to receive SMS messages in a Google Spreadsheet, and created a pretty nice walkthrough of the entire setup.Providing this type of functionality helps, as Twilio says, make it easy for developers and non-developers alike to receive SMS messages in a Google Spreadsheet”—emphasis on the non-developers.</p>
