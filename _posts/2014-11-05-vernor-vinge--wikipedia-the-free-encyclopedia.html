<p>Vernor Steffen Vinge ( i   /  ˈ   v   ɜr   n   ər   ˈ   v   ɪ   n   dʒ   iː   /; born October 2, 1944) is a retired San Diego State University (SDSU) Professor of Mathematics, computer scientist, and science fiction author.He is best known for his Hugo Award-winning novels and novellas A Fire Upon the Deep (1992), A Deepness in the Sky (1999), Rainbows End (2006), Fast Times at Fairmont High (2002), and The Cookie Monster (2004), as well as for his 1984 novel The Peace War and his 1993 essay The Coming Technological Singularity, in which he argues that the creation of superhuman artificial intelligence will mark the point at which the human era will be ended, such that no current models of reality are sufficient to predict beyond it.Vinge published his first short story, Bookworm, Run!, in the March 1966 issue of Analog Science Fiction, then edited by John W.Campbell.</p>
