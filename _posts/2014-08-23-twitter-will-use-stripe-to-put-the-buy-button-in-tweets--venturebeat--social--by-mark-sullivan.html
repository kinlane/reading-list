<p>The online payments startup Stripe will be working with Twitter to put a “Buy” button in tweets.Twitter users will begin to see the new button later this year, a Re/code report says — probably in time for Christmas.The idea is to allow users to click Buy, then enter their billing and shipping information without ever leaving Twitter.The report cites sources saying that businesses that want to sell products in this way on Twitter should start working with Stripe to set up the back end systems.Stripe is the only e-commerce enabler being mentioned now, but there’s a chance that Twitter will work with others in the future.</p>
