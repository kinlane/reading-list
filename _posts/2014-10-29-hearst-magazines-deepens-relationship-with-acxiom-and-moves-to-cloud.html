<p>Hearst Magazines plans to remove its marketing data from silos and bring it to the cloud using Acxiom.Hearst hopes this move helps it bring together siloed customer information.Finding the overlap between Hearst newspaper and magazine subscribers, for example, is a manual process under the current system.“If a customer engages with us in one channel, we can bring that into another channel.We can do direct mail with email follow-up, or take the fact that you’re a digital subscriber and bring that in,” explained Charlie Swift, VP of strategy and marketing operations at Hearst.</p>
