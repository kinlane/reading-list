<p>Federal government agency 18F, which operates as an intrapreneurial lab within government to encourage rapid adoption of new tech tools and strategies, has released a further series of resources and tools to facilitate API-enablement of government services.While 18F is committed to helping government agencies rapidly prototype and implement a new generation of tech tools, the resources it is releasing are useful for any business moving toward an API strategy.18F, a department of the U.S.General Services Administration, is a unique experiment within government, but one that gives a tangible example of what “open government” advocates around the world aspire to create.</p>
