<p>The first thing on Megan Smith’s to-do list as the third-ever federal chief technology officer should be to implement the plans laid out by her predecessors, according to Aneesh Chopra, who was the first to hold the position.“We’re in execution mode,” Chopra told Bloomberg TV.“They’re going to take the playbook that my successor Todd Park and his colleagues have put forward -- what we started in the first term -- and they’re going to execute, execute, execute.”
The White House announced Thursday that Smith, an executive at Google’s secretive and ambitious research lab Google X, would be the next federal CTO, joined by former Twitter attorney Alexander Macgillivray as deputy CTO.The role of government’s top technology expert was created through executive action by President Barack Obama and was first filled in May 2009 by Chopra, who left the federal government in 2012 and has since founded a company called Hunch Analytics.</p>
