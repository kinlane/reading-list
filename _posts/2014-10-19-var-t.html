<p>// I love art and code.I have spent a few years talking about and teaching programming to people as young as 8 and as old as 80.The one interest Ive been able to map to all ages is art.Teaching people to code using art as a motivation has been a fun learning and teaching experience but, to be quite honest, I could learn a lot more from both subjects.(pronounced vart, which rhymes with fart because I am 12) is a writing, art, and code project that I started to teach me and you about art, as well as to create interactive works that may motivate art lovers to program their own stuff.</p>
