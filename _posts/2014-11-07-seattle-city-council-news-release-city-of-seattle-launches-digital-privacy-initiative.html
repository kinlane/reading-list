<p>City of Seattle  launches digital privacy initiative
The  collection of data occurs in every day City processes, such as paying a utility  bill, renewing a pet license, browsing a web page, or signing up for an email  list.Police, fire and emergency services collect different forms of video and  electronic data.The increasing complexity of emerging technologies, business  systems and laws mean the City must take appropriate steps to facilitate the  collection, use, and disposal of data in a manner that balances the needs of  the City to conduct its business with individual privacy, in a manner that  builds public trust.The  City expects to deliver a completed privacy statement and plan for  implementation to Council by June 2015.City  partners with University of Washington on privacy research 
This  funding, $50,000, was awarded through a request for proposal from the Berkeley  Center for Law and Technology on the exploration of implications of government  release of large datasets.</p>
