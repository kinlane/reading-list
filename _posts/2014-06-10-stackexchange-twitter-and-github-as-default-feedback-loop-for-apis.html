<p>I’m still extracting great examples of API design, deployment, and management, that other API providers can follow, from recent API projects out of our federal government, with FBOpen from 18F, and OpenFDA out of the Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA).This particular post is about the approach to establishing a feedback loop with consumers of the OpenFDA API.If you visit the OpenFDA portal, you will find that API consumers can seek help via three self-service channels: If you don’t get your question answered by searching through existing Github, StackExchange, and Twitter conversations, you have three ways to directly ask the OpenFDA team questions: What is notable (thanks Gray Brooks), is that OpenFDA uses existing services to establish the feedback loop with API consumers—meaning they use Github, StackExchange, and Twitter rather than rolling their own tool.OpenFDA understands that there are existing conversation that are already occurring on StackExchange, and developers are used to going here to find the answers they need.Additionally by stimulating the conversation on StackExchange and Twitter you are generating valuable social media and SEO exhaust that will help new consumers, potentially learn about the OpenFDA API, and how it is being used by developers.</p>
