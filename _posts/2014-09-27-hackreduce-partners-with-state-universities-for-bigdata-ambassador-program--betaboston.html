<p>When Cort Johnson made the move from Terrible Labs to Atlas Venture, some wondered what his specific role at the venture capital firm might be.With the launch of hack/reduce’s “College Ambassador Program,” that becomes a little more clear.Johnson will spearhead the initiative to connect hack/reduce, the MassTech Collaborative, and local colleges and universities in order to build a robust big-data community and mentor the potential leaders of the next generation of big-data companies.The program plans to have two students designated as hack/reduce big-data ambassadors on the campus of a number of Boston-area schools.The ambassadors’ role will be to promote the growth of big-data ideas and startups at the university level, through events, hackathons, and connecting early stage data-focused companies with space to work and learn at hack/reduce.</p>
