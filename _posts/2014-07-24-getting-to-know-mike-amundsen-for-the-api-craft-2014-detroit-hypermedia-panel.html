<p>Im preparing for my hypermedia panel with Mike Amundsen (@mamund), Mike Kelly (@mikekelly85), Steve Klabnik (@steveklabnik), Kevin Swiber (@kevinswiber), JÃ¸rn Wildt (@JornWildt), and Markus Lanthaler (@MarkusLanthaler), at API Craft Detroit next week.I wanted to go into the panel with a snapshot, and at least a minimal understanding of each of the panelists.This is kind of an all-star panel of hypermedia experts, so I need to at least bump up my understanding of what they are contributing to the API space, and who they are, beyond what I know from my own interactions with these API leaders.As I do with all of my research, I wanted to share my work with you, my reader.So, first up is Mike Amundsen.</p>
