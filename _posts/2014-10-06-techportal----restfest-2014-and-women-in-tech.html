<p>Oct 6, 2014 				
Once again I had the absolute pleasure of attending RESTFest over in Greenville, SC between the 25th and 27th September this year.I was going to write a blog post about the brilliant hypermedia content that was brought to the conference by the speakers (and I will), but before I do, I wanted to write about something else.RESTFest is somewhat unique in its structure by nature of being an unconference.There’s very little by way of a fixed schedule – usually just one keynote and a few extended talks may be agreed up front.The rest of the event is put on by those who purchase a ticket and show up.</p>
