<p>One of my favorite gifts that technology gives to the world is making children happy.Whether it’s a toddler giggling while playing a smartphone game, kids video chatting with their grandparents on Skype, or even the miracle of technology as it relates to healthcare, it’s always a joy to watch.Today I’d like to share a story about how technology can turn children who need prosthetic arms and hands into their favorite superhero, and make them the coolest kids on the block in the process.Aaron Brown at E-nabling the Future has discovered how to 3D print prosthetic limbs for children.The designs are inspired by superheroes, and in the pictures below, you can see the Wolverine and Iron Man examples.</p>
