<p>As the FT reports this morning:
My only surprise is that only half of people surveyed thought this because this issue is of enormous, and I suspect, growing concern.It simply is not possible to live in, and believe in, a mixed economy and say that the private sector will have no involvement in the supply of public services.That would be impossible.The question is where to draw the line and to ask how accountability is to be created since accountability is much more the hallmark of the public than the private sector.This blog us not about where to draw the line, although I have clear opinion on the issue.</p>
