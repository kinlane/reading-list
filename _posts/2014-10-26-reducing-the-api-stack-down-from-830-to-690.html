<p>I just finished going through my API Stack, taking a fresh look at each API provider, and recording some information about each of the providers in my API monitoring system.When I started looking through my stack a couple days ago there was 830 companies listed, and after this pass through I carved the stack down to 690--why?APIs Go Away
 It is a fact of life, APIs go away.Im always amazed at how quickly an API will disappear or just fall into disrepair.I donâ€™t have time to assess what exactly has happened to all APIs, but if I get 404s, or cant find signs of an API program in 10 seconds, and a quick Google search, I pull them from the stack.</p>
