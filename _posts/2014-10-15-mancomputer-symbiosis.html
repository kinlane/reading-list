<p>Man-computer symbiosis is an expected development in cooperative interaction between men and electronic computers.It will involve very close coupling between the human and the electronic members of the partnership.The main aims are 1) to let computers facilitate formulative thinking as they now facilitate the solution of formulated problems, and 2) to enable men and computers to cooperate in making decisions and controlling complex situations without inflexible dependence on predetermined programs.In the anticipated symbiotic partnership, men will set the goals, formulate the hypotheses, determine the criteria, and perform the evaluations.Computing machines will do the routinizable work that must be done to prepare the way for insights and decisions in technical and scientific thinking.</p>
