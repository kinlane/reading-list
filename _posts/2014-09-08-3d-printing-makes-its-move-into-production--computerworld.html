<p>When NASAs Juno satellite blasted off for Jupiter, the 3D printed parts in its final assembly represented just one small step toward manufacturer Lockheed Martins goal to eventually build an entire spacecraft using additive manufacturing technology.The launch also signified one giant leap toward the use of 3D printing in the aerospace firms manufacturing processes here on earth.Other businesses are adopting 3D printing in production, too.(See the related blog entry about Ford Racings use of 3D printing.) 
 IT, in response, is buckling up for the ride.</p>
