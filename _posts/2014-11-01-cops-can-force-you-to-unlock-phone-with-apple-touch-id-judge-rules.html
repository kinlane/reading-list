<p>Cops cant make you give them your smartphone password -- but they can compel you to slap your finger onto your Apple Touch ID device to unlock it, a Virginia court ruled Thursday.Its an odd sort of loophole: The Fifth Amendment protects you from offering knowledge that could incriminate yourself, meaning you dont have to tell a cop your phones password if he or she asks you for it.But you can be required to turn over physical evidence or DNA information.In the Virginia case, the  judge ruled that a fingerprint is considered a physical object -- and police are allowed to force you to give it to them.Apples Touch ID lets you unlock your iPhone or iPad with your fingerprint, saving you the trouble of typing in a password.</p>
