<p>Kin Lane coined the phrase “The Politics of APIs,” referring to all of the issues and decisions made around designing, developing, distributing and consuming APIs.These are things like Terms of Service/licensing, service level agreements and branding.Naturally, there are a lot of intersections with your API products (technological and business) and these politics, and they often are strongly related.The key conflict in APIs stems less from APIs themselves than from the nature of structured information and the presumed “openness” of the web.One of the advocates for the open web might argue like so:
The web is an open standard.</p>
