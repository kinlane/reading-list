<p>Another layer to the release of Codenvy this week, was the announcement of the Eclipse project Che, an open source project to create a platform for SAAS developer environment that contains all of the tools, infrastructure, and processes necessary for a developer to edit, build, test, and debug an application”.Che represents the next generation IDE that runs in the cloud, which coincides with other signs Ive seen around API discovery moving into the IDE with signals from API pioneers like SalesForce and Google, or from Microsoft in Visual Studio.I’m still learning about Che, but I’m beginning to see two distinct ways Che and APIs can be employed.First lets start with the environment:
You can build extensions for Che, and when those extensions are compiled into the kernel, Che creates server-side microservices, a RESTful API, and cross-browser optimized JavaScript, which is then pluggable into a browser IDE.With Che, developers are given the pluggable structure of Eclipse, but accessible through a cloud environment.</p>
