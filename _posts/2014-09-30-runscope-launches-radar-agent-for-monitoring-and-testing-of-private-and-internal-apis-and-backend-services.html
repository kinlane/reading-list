<p>Runscope has been helping thousands of developers and platform providers with robust cloud-based API testing, monitoring and debugging tools.Users of Runscope Radar have been able to created automated API tests for Internet-accessible backend services, complete with assertions and multiple testing locations around the world.However, many companies have APIs that live solely behind a firewall, only accessible from within the private network.Runscope now offers the Runscope Radar On-premises Agent, bridging Runscope to private APIs not available over the public internet.By running the agent within a private infrastructure, Runscope Radar can now monitor and test against endpoints that are otherwise inaccessible through the internet.</p>
