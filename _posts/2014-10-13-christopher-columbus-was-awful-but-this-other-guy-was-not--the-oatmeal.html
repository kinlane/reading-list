<p>All of the information in this essay came from A Peoples History of the United States, by Howard Zinn, and Lies My Teacher Told Me, by James W.Loewen, 		both of which uses primary sources such as eyewitness accounts, journal entries, and letters from Christopher Columbus himself.This issue keeps coming up and, despite my footnotes, I keep seeing commentary about it so Im going to address it here.Initially, Bartolom√© de las Casas advocated the use of African slaves instead of native labor.In the first few years after he renounced his land and title, his initial cause was to end the suffering of the natives,  		rather than seeking an end to the institution of slavery itself, and so this became his deplorable rationale for the endorsement of African slavery.</p>
