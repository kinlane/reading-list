<p>Ive been tracking on the API from the US Census Bureau since they launched in 2012, and even met with them to discuss their strategy over the last couple years.The team at the Census Bureau has slowly integrated an external API into their operations, opening up conversations around census survey data, that is harder to achieve from just downloads only.I recently saw a post that Census Bureau is gearing up for the 2020 census.As I was reading the post, I couldnt help but think about how the Census API will influence how the 2020 census is executed.Additionally I wonder if any other APIs will be used during the census process, such as Twitter or other social platforms.</p>
