<p>Dropbox’s Datastore API, which gives apps a lightweight cloud database for storing structured user data, like settings and contacts, has been extended to let apps store data locally if users aren’t logged into Dropbox.The Datastore API now also lets users share their data with others, and has a new feature designed to simplify and improve how web apps get notified about changes in the data repositories, Dropbox announced Wednesday.“This is the biggest update to the Datastore API we’ve made since launching it last year,” said Leah Culver, Dropbox developer advocate.The Local Datastores feature, in preview mode since June and now ready for prime time, lets apps collect data from users who aren’t signed into Dropbox, and then ships it to the cloud and syncs it across devices once they log in.The API now also lets developers configure their apps so that users share their data with other Dropbox users.</p>
