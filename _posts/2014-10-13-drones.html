<p>Drones were coming up in my monitoring so much, I had to start tracking on it.While not completely API related (yet), drones represent one possible dystopian universe for the whole Internet of Things API expansion.Im betting that very few folks opt for API layers in their drone operations.Well, not APIs as we know them in the public space.They will use APIs, and try to remain as secretive as possible, but like many other layers of the IoT space, their APIs will become their achilles heel.</p>
