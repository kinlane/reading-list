<p>Brian Koles is Head of Business Development at ChallengePost – a platform and community for growing developer ecosystems though online software competitions and in-person hackathons.The tide of software that’s currently steamrolling every industry has left companies of all sizes with a choice between relying on internal innovation to stay relevant, or allowing third-party developers to weave their content, data and systems into new and exciting applications.Companies wisely choosing the latter have opened their doors by launching 11,400+ public APIs and tasking droves of developer evangelists with championing adoption.So how do you grow a community of developers to use your tools in new and exciting ways?It’s a tough gig.</p>
