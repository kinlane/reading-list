<p>This White Paper is published jointly from APImetrics and OAuth.io – a copy can be downloaded from here. Please feel free to comment or contact us to ask questions.The idea behind OAuth is simple – a standard way to enable access to protected resources (like a social network), so a user can sign into a web service, and, via a secure exchange of tokens, an app or 3rd party can access that service. All happening without the developer ever seeing the user’s username or password.</p>
