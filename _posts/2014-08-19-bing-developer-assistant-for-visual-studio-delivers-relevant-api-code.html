<p>The Bing Developer Center team has released a pretty interesting pluginthat assist developers who use Visual Studio when building web or mobile applications using APIs.In an effort to make developers lives easier, the Bing Developer Assistant now comes with integrated API code search that, â€œwhile coding, a relevant code snippet related to your current API will be automatically displayed in the IntelliSense window which is powered by Bing Code Search.Code snippets are short piece of code that you can easily learn and copy, and you can copy the code, or click the source URL to view where the code snippet comes from, or click Search More to find more code samples related to the API.Which seems like it could easily be extended to other aspects of the API, using APIs.json url type, allowing for the discovery of videos, how-to, and other supporting API resources.</p>
