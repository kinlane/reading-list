<p>Reversing climate change means investing in green energy, and as the sustainable sector grows, ensuring it grows in both developing and developed countries.Today the Fondo Multilateral de Inversiones and Bloomberg New Energy Finance are launching a vastly expanded Climatescope, to provide open data about green energy investment in 55 countries.The data provided by Climatescope creates an information-rich environment for green energy investors.It also provides valuable data on clean energy policies for activists and policymakers.We worked on the Climatescope website with Flipside, a smart, new open source technology shop based in Lisbon.</p>
