<p>It is a pretty basic concept—look at other competing or complimentary APIs in the space, before designing your own.This seems like common sense to me, but I look at APIs for a living, and I’m interested in finding the best API patterns across business or government sectors.Even though this topic seems like a no-brainer to me, I still encounter many folks who contact me to discuss their API strategy, but have not looked at any APIs, in the same genre as the one they are looking to enter--which tells me I should be writing about this topic on a regular basis.My first advice to any API provider, looking to begin new API effort, is to look at as many of the leading APIs out there, as you have time for.Even if they aren’t in the same genre as your API, they are leaders for a reason, and do many things that you can learn from.</p>
