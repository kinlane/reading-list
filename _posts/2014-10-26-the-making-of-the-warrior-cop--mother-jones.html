<p>By 7:30 on Thursday morning, the capacious ground-floor convention center of the Oakland Marriott was filled with SWAT teams.Mostly men, mostly white, dressed in camouflage or black fatigues, they stood in groups of eight or ten, some eating pastries, others sticking to coffee and a dip of tobacco.A few wandered the expo hall, stopping by booths to test the feel of armored vests, boot knives, and sniper rifles, grab swag like grenade-shaped stress balls, or drop tickets into a box for a raffle of iPhone covers and pistols.Want to see the new toy?a vendor asked a police officer in camo.</p>
