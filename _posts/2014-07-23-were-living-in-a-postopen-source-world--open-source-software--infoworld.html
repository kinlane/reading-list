<p>After years of bitter feuds between free software and open source advocates, open source won.But it was a temporary victory.While proponents of Apache-style licensing had a brief period to gloat, the GitHub generation seems determined to take open source to its logical conclusion: releasing most software under no license at all.Are developers simply too careless to bother with a license, or is something bigger under way?Good-bye to the GPLThe GPL family of licenses has been in decline for some time (also see RedMonks analysis), tumbling down to 50 percent of all open source licenses used in 2012 and now hovering at 45 percent, even as Apache-style licensing has climbed to 42 percent from 30 percent in 2012, according to data compiled by Black Duck Software.</p>
