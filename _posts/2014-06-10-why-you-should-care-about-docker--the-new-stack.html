<p>As I wander in the midst of excited conversations at Dockercon, I wonder: how do I explain Docker to my wife, at home in Portland, as she stays home, watching and wondering about my sick 18 month old.What is so compelling about Docker that would have me go 600 miles away to hang around with geeky 30 year-olds?Much of the news out of Docker right now requires you to know the vagaries of cgroups, systemd, and LXC.Starting a conversation with those technologies is a sure fire way to end the conversation unless you have a Stack Overflow or Server Fault ranking over 1K.I wanted to discover what made people excited about Docker beyond these highly technical terms, and figure out what makes their jobs easier, what streamlines business applications, what makes companies stronger.</p>
