<p>I participated in the API Summit at Edmunds.com yesterday.The event brought in API professionals from Mashery, Netflix, SOA Software, Ticketmaster, and EPAM Systems to discuss APIs, internally with the Edmunds team.The API gathering was just like any other API event I have participated in, with a lineup of 30-60 minute keynotes from API professionals, accompanied by food, drink and networking in between, as well as after the event.The only difference was the API Summit was smaller and all about Edmunds.</p>
