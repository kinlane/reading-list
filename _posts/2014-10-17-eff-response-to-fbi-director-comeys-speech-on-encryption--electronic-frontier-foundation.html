<p>FBI Director James Comey gave a speech yesterday reiterating the FBIs nearly twenty-year-old talking points about why it wants to reduce the security in your devices, rather than help you increase it.Heres EFFs response:
The FBI should not be in the business of trying to convince companies to offer less security to their customers.It should be doing just the opposite.But thats what Comey is proposingâ€”undoing a clear legal protection we fought hard for in the 1990s.1 The law specifically ensures that a company is not required to essentially become an agent of the FBI rather than serving your security and privacy interests.</p>
