<p>Its no secret that libraries are among our most democratic institutions.Libraries provide access to information and protect patrons right to explore new ideas, no matter how controversial or subversive.Libraries are where all should be free to satisfy any information need, be it for tax and legal documents, health information, how-to guides, historical documents, childrens books, or poetry.And protecting unfettered access to information is important whether that research is done using physical books or online search engines.But now it has become common knowledge that governments and corporations are tracking our digital lives, and that surveillance means our right to freely research information is in jeopardy.</p>
