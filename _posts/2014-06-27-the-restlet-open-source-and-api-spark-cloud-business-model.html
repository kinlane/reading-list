<p>I’m always on the hunt for common patterns that are working within the API space, and shine light on them, work to understand why they work, so that others can emulate these successful patterns in the space.One approach I’ve seen work well, in many situations, is a combination of open source and a Platform as a Service (PaaS), and I’m going to highlight the implementation of this model by one of the API Evangelist partners—Restlet / APISpark.Open Source For Developers First and foremost, Restlet is an open source web API framework, that any developer can download, and install to deliver their own API.The community benefits from this, Restlet benefits from this—open source API tooling is a fundamental building block for all of this to work.Many companies feel that open sourcing their core platform is just giving away their intellectual property, when in reality many consumers of your software won’t have the resources to implement on their own, and will still need consulting resources to get the solution off the ground.</p>
