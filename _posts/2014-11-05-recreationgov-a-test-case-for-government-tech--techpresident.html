<p>A request for proposals under consideration for a new revamping of recreation.gov, the governments portal for outdoor trip planning, could be an opportunity to apply the innovative vision of 18F, the new digital services team within the General Services Administration, established in the spring, and of the new U.S.Digital Service within the Office of Management and Budget, civic technologists say.While the RFP as it stands illustrates many of the well-known problems that have been typical of the established procurement process, civic advocates say that is precisely a reason why there is still time for the initiatives involvement to make a difference.</p>
