<p>We’re moving quickly in our quest to bring Pocket to the rest of the world.Just last month, the Pocket platform became multilingual and available in French, German, Italian, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish.As of today, the Pocket platform is available in six new languages: Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Dutch, Korean, Polish, and Portuguese.In addition to a fully-translated platform – including Pocket’s packaged Chrome App – we’ve also made significant improvements to Article View accuracy for these languages.A special shoutout goes to all of our users who’ve helped us with translations over the past few weeks.</p>
