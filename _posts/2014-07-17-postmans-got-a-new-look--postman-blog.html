<p>One thing has remained constant since Postman came to life.That has been the Postman app icon and the ‘logo’.There is not much to say about them, except that not many people were big fans.This changes today with Postman’s new brand identity.When we started thinking about the product as well as the direction we are heading in, it made sense to take a comprehensive look at our identity instead of just creating a pretty app icon.</p>
