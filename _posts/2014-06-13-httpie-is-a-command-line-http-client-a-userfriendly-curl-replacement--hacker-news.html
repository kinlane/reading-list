<p>This is one of the little known gems I recommend often.the readability difference is just amazing for me.On that note for those of us having to use Windows at the workplace there are a few things that make life easier: 1) Chocolatey (package manager) 2) HTTPie 3) ConEmu (Shell) 4) gow (Unix command line utilities in Windows) 5) WinMerge (win diff) 6) TortiseSVN 7) SourceTree (git) Makes day to day stuff much smoother.You (and anyone reading this great list of recommendations) should try cmder.Its a customized build of ConEmu with lots of goodies thrown in.</p>
