<p>We have released over a million images onto Flickr Commons for anyone to use, remix and repurpose.These images were taken from the pages of 17th, 18th and 19th century books digitised by Microsoft who then generously gifted the scanned images to us, allowing us to release them back into the Public Domain.The images themselves cover a startling mix of subjects: There are maps, geological diagrams, beautiful illustrations, comical satire, illuminated and decorative letters, colourful illustrations, landscapes, wall-paintings and so much more that even we are not aware of.The librarians behind the project freely admit that they don’t exactly have a great handle on the images in the collection.They know what books the images come from.</p>
