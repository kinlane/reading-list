<p>Those moules frites you had at the French bistro last night were delicious, but now youre feeling kind of funny.Worse than funny.Actually, youre trapped in your bathroom, suffering from food poisoning.Who are you going to tell about this?Many cities have hotlines where citizens can report getting food poisoning from restaurants, but not everybody uses them.</p>
