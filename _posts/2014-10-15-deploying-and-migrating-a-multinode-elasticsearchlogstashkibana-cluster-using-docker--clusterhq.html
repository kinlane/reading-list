ElasticSearch has exploded in popularity recently and it seems like almost everyone is using it for something, big or small. Running ElasticSearch in production, however, does not have a reputation of being easy. First, most people don’t just run ElasticSearch, they run the full ELK stack which is ElasticSearch, Logstash and Kibana. Each of these services plays a role, and for real workloads, that probably means that you want to deploy each service to its own server which introduces complexities around multi-node deployment as well as networking.</p>
