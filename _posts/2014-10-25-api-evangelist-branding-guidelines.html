<p>As my presence grows, Im feeling the need to better protect the integrity of the API Evangelist brand, and in the world of APIs it is common for providers to have a branding guidelines page.Following the lead of API proviers I monitor, I have created this branding guidelines page to help you better understand how to positively use API Evangelist images.API Evangelist Logo
Lets start with the official API Evangelist logo.Even though this logo was entirely by accident, the result of me having zero graphic design skills, it has become a significant part of my brand, and recognizable because of the t-shirts I wear when on the road.I do not mind if you print the logo on any t-shirt you desire.</p>
