<p>Ken Burns: The History of Computing I’m enjoying Mike Amundsen’s keynote from API Strategy &amp; Practice in Amsterdam again, Self-Replication, Strandbeest, and the Game of Life What von Neumann, Jansen, and Conway can teach us about scaling the API economy.As I listen to Mike’s talk, and other talks like Bret Victor’s “The Future of Programming”, I’m reminded of how important knowing our own history is, and for some strange reason, in Silicon Valley this is we seem to excel at doing the opposite, and making a habit of forgetting our own history of computing.The conversation around remembering the history of compute came up between Mike Amundsen and I, during the beer fueled discussion in the Taproom at Gluecon in Colorado, last May.As we were discussing the importance of the history of technology, the storytelling approach of Ken Burns came up, and Mike and I were both convinced that Ken Burns needs to do a documentary series on the history of computing.There is something about the way that Ken Burns does a documentary that can really reach our hearts and minds, and Silicon Valley needs a neatly packaged, walkthrough of our computing history from say 1840 through 1970.</p>
