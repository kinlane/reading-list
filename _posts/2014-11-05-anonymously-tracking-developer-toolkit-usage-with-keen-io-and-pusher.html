<p>For a recent hack day Andy Berry and I decided to add opt-in anonymous usage tracking to the BladeRunnerJS toolkit.We used Keen IO to capture, analyse and visualise the statistics, and Pusher to add realtime updates to BladeRunnerJS dashboard app we built.In this post Ill cover why we wanted to do this and how it was achieved.You can also take a look at the Live BRJS Usage Dashboard.You can put in a lot of time and effort into open sourcing a project.</p>
