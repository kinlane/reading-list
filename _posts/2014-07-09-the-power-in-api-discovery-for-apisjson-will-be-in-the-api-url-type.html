<p>An APIs.json file lives in the root of any domain, or subdomain, and provides references to a collection of API resources.The APIs.json is meant to be a lightweight framework, where someone can build a collection of APIs, give it a name, description, some tags, and the APIs collection points you where you need to go, to get more information about those APIs.For each API, you can define a list of URLs, each with a defining “type”, letting you know what to expect when you visit the URL.</p>
