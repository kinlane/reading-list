<p>I remember all the pain and suffering I used to go through in the old days looking for a place to park my server side code, leading me to eventually invest in my own servers, and rack at a datacenter.All of this changed with Amazon S3 & EC2.After 2008 I migrated everything to the cloud, selling all my servers, and never looking back.As I complete two stories, one one an innovative API deployment platform called Blockspring, and the other on automation platform Temboo’s new JavaScript SDK for the 100+ API platforms Temboo connects with.Both of these evolutions in technology, and evolution in cloud computing, reflect one possible future where the concept of “server side code” will fade away, bringing us closer to a more programmable web.</p>
