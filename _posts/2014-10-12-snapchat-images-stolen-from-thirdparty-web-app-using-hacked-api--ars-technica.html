 	  An alleged cache of about 13 gigabytes of stolen images from Snapchat—some of them apparently of nude, underage users of the “ephemeral” messaging platform—was posted online Thursday night, many of them to the image-sharing site 4chan’s /b/ discussion board.However, the threads linking to the images have largely been shut down by 4Chan over concerns of trafficking in what could be considered child pornography.</p>
