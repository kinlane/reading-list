<p>Married adults under age 65 were more likely to have health insurance coverage than people who were never married or were divorced, separated or widowed.Today, the Census Bureau released new health insurance coverage estimates for 2013 that may provide some insight.In addition to estimates of the number of people without health insurance coverage for the entire 2013 calendar year, the Census Bureau also presents estimates of types of coverage for those who had health insurance, whether private or government-provided.Looking at these statistics, we find that the relationship between marital status and health insurance coverage may differ for men and women (Figure1).Both married men and married women have the lowest uninsured rates.</p>
