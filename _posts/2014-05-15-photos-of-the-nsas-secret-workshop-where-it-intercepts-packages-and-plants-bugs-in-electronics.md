<p>A new NSA document that has been revealed in Glenn Greenwalds book No Place To Hide shows images of the agency intercepting packages to implant bugs, according to Sean Gallagher at Ars Technica.  The NSAs Tailored Access Operations (TAO) unit hijacked routers, servers, and other network gear before they were delivered to customers. TAO specifically targeted packages that were headed toward organizations that were marked for surveillance, although the names of these companies havent been revealed.  The document, a newsletter that dates back to June 2010 from the head of the NSAs Access and Target development department, includes photos of the agency opening a router from Cisco and installing beacon firmware.These types of systems, according to Ars Technica, were described as being some of the most productive operations in TAO because the preposition access points into hard target networks around the world.</p>
