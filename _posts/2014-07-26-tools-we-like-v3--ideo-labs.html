<p>The other day at lunch I was talking my colleague’s ear off about various technologies I like to use and why I like to use them.I decided to compile a list, which I shared with all my co-workers at IDEO New York.Why stop there?All of these technologies have helped me immensely, so for the benefit of all you Labs readers, here are my favorite tools.I’ve grouped them together so you can jump straight to what interests you: tools to build a dynamic mobile app, tools to create and deploy a web server, great UX design frameworks, and generally helpful workflow utilities.</p>
