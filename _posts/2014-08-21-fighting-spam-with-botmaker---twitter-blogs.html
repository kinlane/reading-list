<p>Spam on Twitter is different from traditional spam primarily because of two aspects of our platform: Twitter exposes developer APIs to make it easy to interact with the platform and real-time content is fundamental to our user’s experience.These constraints mean that spammers know (almost) everything Twitter’s anti-spam systems know through the APIs, and anti-spam systems must avoid adding latency to user-visible operations.These operating conditions are a stark contrast to the constraints placed upon more traditional systems, like email, where data is private and adding latency of tens of seconds goes unnoticed.So, to fight spam on Twitter, we built BotMaker, a system that we designed and implemented from the ground up that forms a solid foundation for our principled defense against unsolicited content.The system handles billions of events every day in production, and we have seen a 40% reduction in key spam metrics since launching BotMaker.</p>
