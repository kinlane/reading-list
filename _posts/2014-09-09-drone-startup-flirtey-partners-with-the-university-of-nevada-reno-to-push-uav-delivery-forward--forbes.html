<p>Originally from Australia, I spent 4 years in Beijing  where I was a co-founding member and English Editor of TechNode, one of Asiaâ€™s leading independent tech media that now manages TechCrunch China.I covered stories on local entrepreneurs, start-ups and tech trends that shape life in Asia and especially China.After TechNode, I co-founded Koombah.com, an online to offline start-up to help expats find rental housing in Beijing.I started my career in the corporate professional services industry in Sydney, where I worked as an accountant for Ernst & Young and management consultant for various boutique firms across strategy, operations and marketing.</p>
