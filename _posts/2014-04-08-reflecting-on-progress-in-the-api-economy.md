<p>This week we had the pleasure of heading to Seoul for the WWW conference and first stop was a great API Meetup hosted by Daum DNA at D.Camp.Great audience and myself an Mike Amundsen we’re on speaking duty.The event flyer is here.For the event I was asked to prepare an overview of the current state of APIs and the API Economy, which is a daunting task – John Musser’s great presentations (here and here) are hard to follow, so I didn’t try.</p>
