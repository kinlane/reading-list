<p>One of the best parts of my job is working with companies on their API strategy.You learn a lot about them that way.Opening up services with an API is more than an engineering project.For most, it’s a new way of thinking about their business.And having seen these projects close up, I can tell you that certain approaches to APIs work, and others work, let’s say, less well.</p>
