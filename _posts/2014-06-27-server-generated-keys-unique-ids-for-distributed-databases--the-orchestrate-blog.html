<p>Long before I had ever met a “distributed database,” I already had a great relationship with my relational database.I loved it for its BTree indexes, and I admired it for its UNIONs and JOINs.But the feature I used most often was probably the humble auto-incrementing primary key: a quick, simple way to guarantee unique keys for any table.These days, with most of my work now using distributed databases, I miss having those automatically generated, guaranteed-unique, ascending keys.If you’ve worked with distributed databases, you’ve probably scratched your head more than once trying to create system-wide unique primary keys for all your objects.</p>
