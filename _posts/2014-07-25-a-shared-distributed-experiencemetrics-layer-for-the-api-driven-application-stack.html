<p>I’m in the middle of processing multiple emails, as well as coming down off an early morning conversation, all on the subject of analytics.A portion of the conversations are about analytics at the web site, web or mobile app level, and a portion of it was around analytics for API developers, as well as API platform providers—basically the full stack of analytics including platforms, developers, apps, all the way to the end-user.Increased visibility into the API layer, and how developers and their apps are consuming API resources, is a cornerstone of API management.There are numerous solutions out there to give you analytics in websites and web apps (Google Analytics), and within the mobile app itself (Mixpanel), and there are analytics at the API layer for both API providers, and the many developers who are integrating APIs into their applications and systems (3Scale).API providers, with the assistance of API infrastructure solutions like 3Scale, have done very well in making sense of how resources are composed through a service composition layer, that includes a robust number of metrics and analytics for both provider and developer.</p>
