<p>Last week, we announced the launch of our new suite of financial transparency apps.These apps, Socrata Open Budget and Socrata Open Spending, have been designed for citizens to help them understand government finances.We worked with governments from Montgomery County, Maryland, and Boston, Massachusetts, to build on the work we did with New York City and Checkbook NYCÂ and ensure that everyone, from the average citizen to the data analyst and journalist, could better understand how governments budget and spend money.To introduce these apps, we will be holding a live webinar on April 16th at 2:00 p.m.</p>
