<p>As the API lifecycle continues to expand and comes into focus, new services are emerging to help both API providers, and consumers, better manage API operations from start to finish.New API integration services like Runscope have emerged to better understand how APIs are actually being consumed, and services like APIMaticÂ are born out of the need to produce better quality SDKs for developers--it only seems natural that eventually these services would start working together.APIMatic will now generate SDKs in 7 languages that are designed, and enabled to inspect/debug all of the requests and response data between their API, and the applications that depend on them.This will provide both API provider, and consumer with vital details on the integration in real-time, that can help ensure applications integrations are all optimized.All of this is made possible because Runscope has APIs, and APIMatic was savvy enough to weave in integration, monitoring and testing capabilities directly into the SDKs of any API.</p>
