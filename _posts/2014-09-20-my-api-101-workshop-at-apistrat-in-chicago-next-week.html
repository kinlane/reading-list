<p>Iâ€™m working on the details of my API 101 workshop with Kirsten Hunter (@synedra) next week.She is delivering most of the content for the 2 hour workshop, as she has evolved a pretty sophisticated set of API 101 materials.My contribution will be from my history of APIs, and my API trends material, helping people understand the how we got here, and some thoughts on where we are going.History of APIs
 As I continue to make sense of the API space, Im evolving my history of APIs story, adding and consolidating areas that I think have significantly contributed to the overall growth of the API space.While I track on 100+ categories, or business sectors, in which I think APIs are being applied in some interesting ways, I feel these seven areas are the cornerstones of the app, and its underlying API economy.</p>
