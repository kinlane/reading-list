<p>Throughout 2014, when I look at the top 10 posts in my Google Analytics dashboard each month, there has been a consistent theme of what stories are driving page views.The concept of a page is only one metric I look at when evaluating where the API space might be going, and while I don’t write stories specifically to page views, they do provide me with a general barometer of what my readers are interested in.I’m seeing give areas consistently generating the most views across the API Evangelist Network:
Internal APIs - This slot is pretty much dominated by The Secret To Amazons Success Is Internal story getting thousands of page view each month, even with being written back in January of 2012.Single Page App Tooling - Simple, easy to use formable single page apps like my CSV Converter, and my Data.Ongithub.</p>
