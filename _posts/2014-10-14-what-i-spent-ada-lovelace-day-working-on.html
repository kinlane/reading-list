<p>As I track on the API space, the gender gap becomes increasingly obvious.As with many other guys, Iâ€™m struggling with coming up with the most constructive way that I can contribute to closing the gender gap in technology.As I do with the rest of the API space, I figured I can work harder to tell more stories about women doing interesting things in the API space, while also working to understand the history of women in the space.With this in mind I took the opportunity on Ada Lovelace Day, to publish a project dedicated tracking on women doing interesting things in the world of APIs, and as with the other 75+ projects, I will spend time each month moving the project forward.My goal is to find more stories for my blog, more speakers and attendees for API industry events, and make sure women are better represented across my research.</p>
