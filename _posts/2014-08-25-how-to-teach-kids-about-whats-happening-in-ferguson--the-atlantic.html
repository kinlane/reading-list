<p>When the unrest in Ferguson erupted, my husband made an observation that broke my heart: “The kids were supposed to start school today.”  
For me, the perfume of synthetic fibers and freshly sharpened pencils always signals the start of a new school year, and it makes me ecstatic.As a child, the ritual began with a trip to the uniform store.My older sister and I trekked onto Clark Street via a city bus.Each year, we found ourselves before the counters of what had to be the world’s largest purveyor of Catholic school uniforms.</p>
