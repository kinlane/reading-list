<p>One conversation I had at #Gluecon this year, was around the role an API plays in being a contract between providers and consumers, with Tony Tam (@fehguy) from Reverb.API contract, is a common phrase to describe how API services are consumed, and depending on the on-boarding process, an API provider and consumer can enter into a contract for services around a set of resources, in a self-service way.In the last couple years, with the increased use of API definition formats like API Blueprint, Swagger, and RAML, we often reference this API definition as a tangible representation of the contract API providers and consumers enter into.In my mind, I see the API definition as one building block, in a larger set of building blocks, that are working together to form a contract, with the API definition acting as the truth.If you step back and look across multiple API providers, you start to see a variety of building blocks that contribute to the overall API Contract, that is negotiated between API provider and consumer, starting with the API definition.</p>
