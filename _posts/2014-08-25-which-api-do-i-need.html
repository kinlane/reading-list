<p>I was looking around the Google Developer area as part of some regular work, and I noticed an interesting page Google has under their mapping session, that help users decide which API they needÂ based upon their goals.As the page says: The API picker lists the most common things you may want to do on a map or with location-based data, and suggests the API that most suits your needs.For details about each API, follow the links to the related documentation.I dont think that the table layout Google uses is a particularly good one, resulting in a pretty busy looking matrix.I dont think it is a perfect solution, but I like the idea of providing developers with some sort of assistance in understand which API to use, based upon their goals.</p>
