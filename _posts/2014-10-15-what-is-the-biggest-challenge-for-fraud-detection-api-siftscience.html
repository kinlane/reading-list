<p>I’m spending more time reaching out directly to API providers, in an effort to better understand what they are up to.A couple weeks ago, I asked Sarfaraz Rydhan (@safoo) from the Fraud Detection API platform SiftScience, what is the biggest challenge you face in attracting developers to your system?In many cases, the biggest challenge is developers needing context into the business and operations side of the companies they work for.We offer a machine learning powered fraud detection product to help internet companies in many verticals fight fraud.In an e-commerce integration, for example, a developer may need to know about how users interact with the store, when a customers credit card is charged, how order information is sent to the warehouse for fulfillment, how operations analysts work within the e-commerce system.</p>
