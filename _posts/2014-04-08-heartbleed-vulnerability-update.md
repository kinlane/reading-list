<p>As an infrastructure provider, we handle all security matters with the utmost seriousness.Before we rush to make changes, we try to analyze the issue, identify what might be affected, and work to provide the best possible fix.Phaxio is hosted on Amazon Web Services and makes use of its Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) service.Because we terminate our SSL connections using ELB, there was a time when our services may have been vulnerable to Heartbleed.We closely followed the updates posted by AWS and have been assured that all affected load balancers have been updated and are no longer vulnerable.</p>
