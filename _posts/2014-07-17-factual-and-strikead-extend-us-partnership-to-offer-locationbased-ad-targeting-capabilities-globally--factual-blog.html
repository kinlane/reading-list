<p>We are excited to announce the extension of our partnership with StrikeAd, the leader in programmatic advertising across multiple devices.While StrikeAd has been running mobile ad campaigns using Factual’s Geopulse Audience and Geopulse Proximity products in the US since the beginning of 2014, StrikeAd is now rolling these targeting capabilities out on a global basis, enabling their European and Asian clients to use the sophisticated location-based targeting capabilities that Geopulse Audience and Geopulse Proximity provide.Both Geopulse Audience and Geopulse Proximity leverage our Global Places data, a comprehensive, global dataset that covers over 65 million local businesses and other points of interest in 50 countries.Global Places covers all of Western Europe and the largest markets in Asia, including China, India, Japan, South Korea, and Australia, so StrikeAd’s global clients can run highly targeted campaigns in all of their major markets.Geopulse Proximity enables StrikeAd’s clients to use location-based targeting techniques such as geofencing and geoconquesting in their mobile campaigns.</p>
