<p>Today, we are excited to unveil new support for advanced encoding formats through our Zencoder service.Zencoder will now support HEVC, MPEG-2, MPEG-TS, JPEG 2000 and AVC-Intra, bringing the power of cloud encoding to broadcast and professional workflows.Additionally, Zencoder will also support MXF container for conformity with DPP guidelines for European broadcasters.With todays announcement, Zencoder is applying the elastic scalability of the cloud to solve encoding challenges for a new segment of the production workflow.Just as Zencoder empowered publishers to rapidly transcode video to support the fragmented Web and mobile ecosystem, the service is now enabling broadcasters and professional content providers to scale their media processing operations in the cloud.</p>
